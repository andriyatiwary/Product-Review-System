  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.

  Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.

  It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.

  Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience.

  ====== waste of money ========1. Camera quality is very poor even 5K range phone camera is better than this.2. No full features of MIUI 12- > Clock icon is not real-time like in other Mi phones. > No one hand mode which is part of MIUI 12 so u cant operate this phone with a single hand.3. Display is also very poor means pixelated and no true colors.4. FM is not wireless works only with wired Headphone

Go for Redmi 8a Dual instead
","

  If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.

  Phone hangs so many times, switch off while using. watching video on YouTube, incoming call doesn't show but ringtone plays, camera quality average, phone performance is below average, battery performance is fine, Amazon services is poor, sends technician, he hard reset the phone then he checks it for 4 or 5 minutes and say it is ok, what if it's performance if you have to hard reset it 2 time during 7 days, because after hard reset every phone works perfectly for some times while technician checks it for 5 to 10 minutes.

Decent overall package for an entry level phone
","

  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks

Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.Screen quality is good.Finger sensor is very quick.Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor.

Redmi 9 review.
","

  Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.

  I bet a Redmi series of phone doesn't need reviews. It's always the best for budget. Only pros is lagging after a while due to more bug fix updates and usage of more apps. Otherwise Redmi rockzzz

Budget wise better display and battery but poor camera
","

  Display better for this price but if you can spend a 1000 rupees more go for Redmi 9 Prime which has better FHD display and good processor than this.  Function is good especially for online classes and also the size of display is good for online classes. Games mild okay.  Camera is really bad in even very light conditions.  Good only in bright places and close-up shots. Overall 3.5 out of 5.

Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range.

Please..... 🙏 don't Buy. Cheapest product from Mi👎Don't Believe in Paid Adverstiment
","

  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy.

  Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone.

Value for money or not?

  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐

  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-.

  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful..

  With Airtel Sim, neither VoLte and VoWifi are working in my phone. Airtel Thanks app is showing your handset is 4G but not VoLte compatible. Same thing in Vodafone. Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi.

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.
","

  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't boot🥵Another round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN 😢😢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day❗Moral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier 🙏

  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance.

  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL.

  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs.

  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!

  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh..

Durable phone, worth every single rupee!
","

  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru

  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful 😍😍😍

DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED
","

  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product.

  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor..

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

My Real Review - M31 is Average
","

  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.

Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop.

  I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been

So setting done now data transfer Samsung's smart switch option is fantastic. Everything I wanted to transfer got it. No problem at all .Now SIM transferred. Done OK it is dual 4G VOLTE and above all it is having separate slot for micro sd card. Effortless working.Now Camera. It has got lot of options. All I have not yet tried but for sure I have checked the quality of the photograph and the night mode is superb. What else you want to know rest of the things are written in detail and is true.

  Cons:1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.Pros:1. Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price.

not up to mark, waste of money

  1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

Review after a week of usage
","

  I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex

  Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time .

HONEST REVIEW BY USER
","

  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)

  It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.

  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually

Ok product for the price range
","

  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.

  I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

Great 📱🔥❤️

  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it

  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.Edit: After 9 months of usage: I am not facing the heating issues now. I had the heating problem while using hotspot for entire day. Battery backup is also good now. But facing some issues in camera. After the latest software update, the photos are some times showing our face like a black and white. This issue is happening only few times and the issue is on only around face. Complained to samsung but no action taken. They are asking for more logs from my phone. Other than this, phone is good to use.

For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR

  hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

Great buy. Excellent camera and battery for this price.
","

  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

  (After 2 months usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.Material is just not very good.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

Best in class, but with a few exceptions
","

  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

  Apart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP. My samsung j7's 8mp is FAR MORE BETTER THAN this one in terms of front camera. FRAUD BY SAMSUNG.Finger prnt reader is not able to detect most of the times.

BAAP of Power and features
","

  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.
","

  A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

Battery consumption
","

  1) From 0 to 100% taking more than 2 hours.2) Battery consuption is high due to default SAMSUNG apps which cannot be deleted and also reducing performance.3) Not possible to Delete NETFLIX4) Even if you download any app from Samsung store you have to upgrade it through Google Play Store, better to directly download latest updated version from Google Play Store directly5) Available RAM for use is only 3.2 GB due to too many unnecessary SAMSUNG APPS are not allowed to uninstall.It was my first and last mobile of NON STOCK ANDROID mobile, earlier used 5 stock android mobiles out of 6 gb RAM it provided 4.8 GB availablity and all non required apps can be deleted so purchasiñg ""Stock android"" mobile is only good option if want to purchase Android mobileDear Samsung - It was not your fault, I wasnt aware that purchasing NON Stock android will have additional mandatory apps of your company, Can you push OTA update for my device and make it stock android?

Not just that , it does not turn on but only the samsung logo shows for 1-2 hours. Now you cant do anything. I went to service center . They kept this phone for 3 days and did nothing . They said to me to pick up my phone after all the data has been deleted and phone's has been reset . And the very next day , here I am with this same problem . I am regretting a lot with samsung .

Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online
","

  Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

An underappreciated budget phone
","

  There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.

Dont be hurry in buying for Samsung M31
","

  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.

Samsung make fool to their customers in the name of warranty

  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....

Disappointing 64MP Camera!!!!

  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

Galaxy M series phone spare part availability issue

  Do not buy this phone.Its display quality is very bad. My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?

This is an average phone just with battery backup only  and not great w r to speed and performance
","

  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

So we understand these things, there's no such thing as ""gorilla vorilla"" it's a normal mirror.

  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

  Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy

Don't buy. Reviewed on 31.10.2020
","

  Here my product review after usage of 3 months.Cons:If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.Macro camera - useless featureFront and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.UI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

Good phone..

  Totally impressed by the built and looks. For 13k I thought of getting realme 6i but the stocks barely last..!So I decided to get this phone. The phone is great and smooth. Gaming experience is also good but not as good as g90t.G85 is a decent processor with great daily life performance!If 12k is your budget go for it..Or 13k..realme 6i and 14k... Go for poco m2. Scarlet red looks stunning!!

Not good like other phones of xiaomi.
","

  My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely.

Excellent choice at this price
","

  Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy

  Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it’s a Piece of shit.Kindly don’t buy Becoz it’s worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that’s all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don’t buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.

🙄Redmi changed lifestyle😎🤭🤷‍♂️
","

  I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.

  Average phone. Good for price. Camera sensor is very poor quality. If you take large 48 MP picture, you can see the dead pixels in the zoomed photo. They glitter like stars. Even if you cover the camera and take photo, these pixels come out white colours.Other than that, everything seems nice. I used a program to uninstall all the crap Xiaomi bloatware from my phone, (like mipay, cleaner, micommunity, etc).As a result I don't see any ads.I play asphalt 9, game runs smoothly in playable fps.Processor Helio G85 is same as G80, nothing extra.Mi UI is crap. My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins. Stock android is best.Final thoughts: Good phone to use for 1 year, 2 at most. Price could have been 1k less.Looking forward to buy pixel 4a next year when price comes down.

  I hope I wouldn't need to edit my comment if it's too early or after I am more experienced with the mobile , but using it for few days after purchasing it recently I would say that it's a beautiful phone with a brilliant display quality and size , faster performance and a more than satisfactory camera quality , not to mention of its huge 128 GB storage capacity. The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it. You will not even find many Google apps in the pre-installed app. Besides that you will be consuming your internet data faster with this phone , you know that.

Sensors problems
","

  I'm aware that when your colour mode is set to auto, the contrast can get really high in sunlight to make the display easier to see. I'm personally not a fan of this feature, so I turned it off on my previous phone.Now I've got the Redmi Note 9  with MIUI 11, but even after setting the colours to default, the contrast still changes in sunlight. What's worse, it tends to ""spas out"" when in a car for instance. It seems that the sensor/software is confused whether or not the contrast should be increased or not, so in the end the display starts to almost flash by continuously lowering and upping the contrast.I've tried restarting the phone, and turning the auto colour feature on and off. The problem still persists. Not sure if this is a bug or not. And if it's not a bug, is there a way to turn the feature off completely?

  Don't purchase it guys, I am not happy about front facing camera, it states 12 mp but works like 5 mp camera, not expected from Xiaomi for camera quality.

Redmi Note 9 Scarlet Red - Xiaomi at it's best again
","

  The look of the phone and color are awesome, for the first time I am using other than black and grey colors in phone.Camera - Selfie is amazing, back camera good but not up to the mark. But, if you select 48MP and took a photo, it is very good.Charging - Super fast, it took less than an hr from 20% - full charge.Weight - When you have case on it, you will feel something we are holding. Of-course every mobile will weigh, when you put the case on it.Performance - Since 2 days I am using it, it's really fast and want to observe more to write about it more.Display - it's large and very clear. Its an edge-to-edge screen and even we can change the settings of display to reduce the display size.Overall, if you are looking for best phone under 12K INR, blindly you can go for it.

  MI has just retained the strategy fash sale marketing to sell this phone. Which is not worthy at all. Performance of the chipset is not good. For this price we can better move on to M series which have a better display.Pros:Camera quality is good.Fast charge is good.Cons:Display is not as good as compared to other phones in this same segmentHeating up when playing gamesBattery back up is just ok.

Real me 6i or redmi note9?
","

  I am having both realme 6i and redmi note 9.I must say,always go for note 9.Realme 6i battery is really a shit.its draining more quickly when compared to note9.This is due to its 90hz display.Also there are heating issues while charging in realme  6i.Redmi note 9 is better in camera on good light conditions when compared to realme6i.Moreover realme  6i comes with 18 watt in box charger and redmi note 9 comes with 22.5 watt in box.even though real me 6i supports 30watt charging ,who's gonna buy that 30 watt charger that costs 1,400 rs.When coming into screen protection realme6i comes with an older version of gorilla glass whereas redmi note 9 comes with latest corning gorilla glass 5 (both camera and screen are protected).There are chances for real me 6i camera to get scratches as it is not protected using gorilla glass whereas note 9' s camera is protected with corning gorilla 5 glass.Final words: if you really worry about battery life then never ever go for realme 6i.A feature called 90 hz display in realme 6i drains it battery quickly.Its better to describe realme  6i as 'fast draining phone' rather than 'fast charging phone'.Guys don't believe in reviewers words as they say good review in favour of the mobile company which gives them better amount.Its better to ask your friends who brought this phone rather than watching review videos.

  Here's my review after using Redmi Note 9 for 3days.Perfect phone for a perfect price. Camera quality is just awesome.If I was to say about the battery, I would like to mention that it doesn't gives much backup. It drains faster. By 10:30pm that is before going to bed at night, I checked the buttery ℅ & it was 41%. When I checked it on morning by 5:30am after waking up, battery % was showing 32%.Without using the phone, 10℅ charge was gone within 7hrs. And also the super fast charging is useless. The phone takes 2.5hrs to charge from 0% to 100℅.Another weak point is that, it is MADE IN CHINA.☹️

  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.

Everything is fine except camera which only works good in sun light
","

  This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.

  Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.

  It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.

  Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience.

Go for Redmi 8a Dual instead
","

  If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.

Worst ever camera
","

  If you ignore this review, you ll end up regretting. Camera quality of this phone is worse than you'd have ever had. If you click a selfie you'll look an old person. No color, no texture. You can say that it's a budget phone and all that. That's true but even a simple one megapixel camera has 100 times better camera. Not exaggerating.Battery also a bit weak. Don't buy

  Writing the review after 3 months of usage.1. Look and fell of the product is good.2. Fingerprint sensor is bit laggy.  Sometimes it didn't read the fingerprints.3. Performance is ok, Can't say it's too slow. But if you want fast performance than go for something else.4. Camera quality is ok. Not too good but not to bad.5. Battery life is good.I bought it for my mom and it serve the purpose.If you want to use all the capabilities of smart phone please look for something else.

Defective piece twice

   First worst experience with amazon while purchasing mobile. There is a small creamish spot inside the screen, could be manufacturing defect or could be the result of improper handling. Even after replacement I got a defective piece again with screen tint issue on the left side of the camera. Video posted. Dropped Amazon and went to Flipkart now.

Redmi 9 mobile not good
","

  phone is not value for moneyThe camera is worst i ever seen in any no redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.mobile display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera. The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime

Phone hangs many times
","

  Phone hangs so many times, switch off while using. watching video on YouTube, incoming call doesn't show but ringtone plays, camera quality average, phone performance is below average, battery performance is fine, Amazon services is poor, sends technician, he hard reset the phone then he checks it for 4 or 5 minutes and say it is ok, what if it's performance if you have to hard reset it 2 time during 7 days, because after hard reset every phone works perfectly for some times while technician checks it for 5 to 10 minutes. Very bad experience with Amazon services and xiaomi product this time.

  Specification good enoughBought for attending online classes and it is very smooth. Have tried streaming videos, MS office files and I have not seen any lags.Not much of a gamer so haven't utilized 100% of HW.Charging time is about 3 hours and lasts more than a day.Camera quality average.1 major concern for me is the display when the phone is operated outdoor. The brightness level is so low we can barely see anything under the sun light

Decent overall package for an entry level phone
","

  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks

Second space is not there in this phone
","

  I have checked it myself that the second space feature is not available in this phone. MI customer care is saying it has second space and service centre saying it does not have . I did not find any better solution other than returning it because a brand like MI is misguiding customers. The hardware is so downgraded that it cannot handle second space . So they have removed the feature from this phone which is available in each and every phone running MIUI. Worst experience ever ......

Don't buy this phone 😞📱

  Writing Review after 1 month use:Over all mobile is quite good in this price range but camera quality is very poor.I would suggest don't buy this phone, go with Redmi 9 Note.Poor camera quality.Bettery life is very good.MIUI 12 (Android 10) is very good. Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.Screen quality is good.Finger sensor is very quick.Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor. If your phone has really any defact then only it will get replaced with same model. You can't return & buy another better model.

  I bought it for my mother, and she is learning to use it. 4GB/64GB at this price is really good. Touch is very responsive and quick. Screen quality is little dull and sound output is low compared to other Redmi phones. Redmi needs to work on these for budget phones. Camera is average as it is not camera centered phone. Network reception and battery power is good, last for 1.5 days with normal usage. Overall good phone for beginners and elderly people to start with

Redmi 9 review.
","

  Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.

  The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase

  Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. 😃

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

Go for any phone but not this if u don't want to regret wasting ur money
","

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  Update 16 Oct 20Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op

  Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. Look of handset is sleek and smart but charer is Normal(Non-USB). To connect with other devices like laptop, PC, you will need to purchase extra USB cable. Backside of phone get heated if using for long time like an hour or more.

  Samsung didn't meet my expectations this time. I had been a big fan of Samsung products and this product of theirs disappointed me. Battery gets hot while watching videos, playing games and when connected to the net. Battery drains fast. Not suitable for video calls. Although I bought a 2GB RAM version, video and voice keeps cutting in and out. Tried different networks. No earphones. Cheap looking charger. Samsung should not compromise on quality. If they cannot afford to release a budget phone, they should not. Instead, continue with their mid and high range phones.

I kept on calling customer care in 6 or 7 calls the phone is not picked up by return agent in 15 days. Money is with Amazon. Which means Amazon is using the money. Not sure how many escalations i have to make replace the productThe product might be good but buying it from Amazon iz a pain.If you are unlucky and phone is dead you will keep begging for return. Your money will be stuck with Amazon.WORST way Amazon India treats the Customer. Better use Amazon not cheap products

Perspective matters!
","

  I do not understand why other reviews mention disappointment with performance. This is a BASIC BUDGET SMARTPHONE! Don't expect SD865 perf.Whom this phone caters to:1) Parents/Grandparents who have basic needs such as Whatsapp and YouTube2) People migrating from feature (button) phones3) Pre-teens' first phoneThe phone is preloaded with Google Go Apps, which are lighter versions of the regular apps.There is no bloatware, and the UI is optimised for the processor.Battery life is decent. Don't expect much. Charging is not fast at all. It takes around 2.5hr for 0-100. But again, this is not a complaint!Screen is 720p. Has a special 'Outdoor Brightness' mode for extra brightness.Speakers are decent. You can hear the ringtone!No face unlock/fingerprint scanner.I bought this phone for my grandmother who is migrating from a Samsung Guru button phone. It is perfect for her usage.Only complaint: This phone is missing a clock widget on the Home Screen!

Worst experience to return the mobile
","

  The mobile contains  poor battery quality. 80% of charge has been drained in 3 hours with average use. Do not buy it to waste your money.Amazon will mention to return or replace product within 7 days, at the time of purchase .But in actual they will delay unnecessarily and will pass the time frame , by different protocols, as nobody can return it . Even if it is  a faulty set and there is a chance to return it.

Value for money, low battery life and does not support fast charging
","

  It's a 2GB phone, you can't expect much, even Facebook lags while going through lots of browsing. The camera is Ok. The build is not good, you must use a rubber cover and temper protection. It has a 3000mah battery that's why discharges quickly and doesn't support fast charging which creates more problems. Overall what you can expect at such a cost?Analyze your needs before purchasing it. The phone is decent for household usage with few apps, but if you want to have multiple apps then don't go for it..

Faulty phone delivered. This seller should not be trusted.
","

  This review is solely for the seller who sold a faulty phone with a huge black spot on the screen. It is so obvious that proper quality check was not done before delivery. This can happen only in case of a used phond being sold as new. Will have to think twice before ordering costly things online, especially in Amazon because as the eshop, Amazon also cannot deny responsibility for this. The headache that I am going through now to return the faulty item is a complete nightmare.

  True Reviews,Worst phone in the world. Don’t see the YouTube reviews and buy this phone they are just lying. I wanted to give it less than one star but there was no option. I looks good in photos but is very very small phone. It lags and sticks a lot even in 2GB ram. A never buy product. Camera is freakin’ waste. They say it has 12MP camera but actually is like 2MP. The apps keep exiting themselves.And says app not responding. The WORST PHONE. Don’t buy this is my honest review. I bought it today and returned the phone on the same day it self within hours . If you wanna waste your money then invest in this phone . The packing and everything is rather soo good but phone does not function good at all.Thank You.

  Don't buy this mobile, it's totally waste.. Camera quality is too bad and battery backup also very slow it takes more than 3 hours to charge fully.. And battery was drained point by point suddenly in the normal usage also.. And heating issue also in this mobile.. Better go with any other brands in this budget..*Return procedure to get refund*In Amazon they say it's a electronic product we can't provide you a refund only we can able to provide you replacement only.. Just accept that they'll send one mobile service field agent to check whether the product is defective or not.. After they approved, they replace the old one and provide you a new one in that same product..In that replacement product also surely you'll face some defects so just ask for an refund directly through the options showing in that order page.. They immediately approve that and within few working days they'll provide you a refund..These kind of electronic product's first time they'll provide replacement offer and second time they'll provide direct refund..

  Screen quality is awesome and performance is at par with any mid range smartphone. Samsung has improved the product performance to a very high level and though i am using iPhones i cou9resist myself of praising the nice quality product by Samsung. The knox security by Samsung in its A series smartphones is a boon to Indian customers, which can't afford ios based ecosystem considering its premium pricing. It's noway lesser efficient than ios. The quality of display in its entry level smartphones is also at par with the best of its class range smartphones. Pl improve the service and policy in the favor of customers. Rest is the best.

  I ignored the negative reviews, especially those about receiving phones that would not turn on.  I paid the price for it.  I received a phone that never turned on- defective.  But, then the worst part was yet to come.  The wait for an inspection.  Then, the worst bit about waiting a few weeks for amazon to pick the package back.  I understand that amazon did its best in these circumstances in the COVID scenario.  I would strongly suggest that this model could be best avoided.  Samsung should seriously consider withdrawing models such as these which are a shame.

Definitely Best choice at the Price from SAMSUNG
","

  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.

  So, I had purchased this set on 8/sep with much excitement but i had never expected that i have to face soo much drama for replacement / refund.phone started heating after every 2minutes use, when you visit om replacement option,  where thr actually no any replacement option , thr is option to download the app or talk to techincan , you have to explain your problem twice- thrice to them...thn they will ask you to download the app..then they will check temperature then they will arrange a techincan visit at your place , after so much of struggle. Then you will will get replacement then again same problem (may persist or maynot be)  In my case i am not satisfied with product i thought it is of Samsung brand so i cn go for it but now there is no any exchange police😔😔 but (Kamchalu type model)!!  you can invest 2k more and can go for a good model...2star...ps- such a long review but it is truthhhhhhh, now i will think twice before purchasing from amazon!!

The phone sometimes just freezes during calls, does not respond to touch, button press or long wait. I consider it a blot on brand Samsung - when they can not build a problem free basic phone then what can be expected from expensive phones?Also, I am not very impressive with the build quality, it is so light that it makes me feel everything inside is just cheap plastic.

  Very nice phone for the price from a proven brand unlike the chinese phones. All good about the phone. Only con is that it is a tad bit slow in general. If Samsung can improve the speed a little bit cheap this would be the best phone to buy at this price range. And this would then simply beat all those cheap chinese phones. Great effort by Samsung but needs a little improvement. Still would recommend this phone for those seeking a value buy from a good brand.

Battery Blunder
","

  Note : for those whose mobile got switched off , press power and volume button at same time . It will be on in safe mode. Then you may restart or can work as it is . ...I purchased for my mother. Because it is small and lightweighted i thought it is perfect for my mom. Previously she had Redmi 7A but because i dont want to have any chinese phone in my home , i decided to exchange with this.Pros : So cute , so small , light weighted , less price , good speed ....cons: Battery , Battery , Battery... My 3 year old J7 2016 (3300Mah )(large screen than this) gave 1 and half day backup and this phone not give backup of single day . MY mother just use 3 to 4 hr daily . Then also My Mom got frustated . She even asked me to give her old phone back. Amazon was not returning this. I gave threat to go to consumer forum and after 2nd visit of technician they understood my problem and gave my money. I really go to consumer court if Amazon wouldnt have accepted my return . Its not about amount but the pain of feeling cheated daily which cause anger. After that i ordered for M21 and contrary to my expectation my mom was happy with large screen . M21 is Awesome . The Best thing about samsung phone is their UI . I love it . So if u r budget conscious then may consider other option but dont go for samsung in less than 10k phone. But I feel that samsung will improve its battery . But i request everyone to not buy chinese product.

Good phone under the 10k bracket for people who want a Made-in-India phone.
","

  My review is based on almost 3 weeks of continuous useage.Battery life - The battery life is very good and easily lasts more than a day. However, charging with the in-box charger is very slow.Camera - The camera isn't bad but it isn't something to boast about. It does fairly well in bright sunlight conditions and not so well in dark conditions wherein the pictures are blurry and full of grains.Screen - The screen is pleasantly bright and legible. Good colour balance and vibrance. However, the touch, at times, feels laggy. Rarely even bordering on non-functional.Performance - Performance is as is expected from a phone in this price range, not very good but not shabby either. It gets basic jobs done and struggles with apps that require more resources.

  Yes  I am happy with the Samsung  MO1 Core phone.  Its got  a  2GB RAM with a Internal memory of 32GB, its got a front and back camera, its got a screen size that is big enough, and fits comfortably in your hand. Best of all its price  is absolutely reasonable  for a phone with 32GB and expandable  upto a little ove 500GB in steps.The only item that I cannot comment on is that it has a  built in battery of 3000 Mah. how long will it last only time will tell, but overall the whole package comes with a 6 month warranty.

  Battery backup, screen quality and camera quality is too poor. Didn't want to buy Chinese, so bought this expecting a good phone. But turned out to be so outdated quality that I felt like I'm living in 2015. Phones released during 2015 had better camera than this phone. Disappointing product from  Samsung when their competitors are offering much better quality phone at same or lower price.

That is after using camera you will not use it anymore even for WhatsApp video call.6. Battery backup standby is good and stands for 2 days.7. Battery charging take more than 3 hrs which makes us keep away from using this mobile phone. Like social media distancing.6. Heating issue occurs while making video calls for 30 minutes.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

My Real Review - M31 is Average
","

  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.

  I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product.

  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

  I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3.

HONEST REVIEW BY USER
","

  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)

I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive..

  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it

  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.Edit: After 9 months of usage: I am not facing the heating issues now. I had the heating problem while using hotspot for entire day. Battery backup is also good now. But facing some issues in camera. After the latest software update, the photos are some times showing our face like a black and white. This issue is happening only few times and the issue is on only around face. Complained to samsung but no action taken. They are asking for more logs from my phone. Other than this, phone is good to use.

  Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.

For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR
","

  hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

LOVE TO SAMSUNG M31 ""MEGA MONSTER""
","

  Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with ""6000 mAh"" monster battery, superb ""64 MP Quad Camera"", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

Great buy. Excellent camera and battery for this price.
","

  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

Disappointing 6000 mah battery & performance, but good amoled display.
","

  (After 2 months usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.Material is just not very good.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

Best in class, but with a few exceptions
","

  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

BAAP of Power and features
","

  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

  A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

  1) From 0 to 100% taking more than 2 hours.2) Battery consuption is high due to default SAMSUNG apps which cannot be deleted and also reducing performance.3) Not possible to Delete NETFLIX4) Even if you download any app from Samsung store you have to upgrade it through Google Play Store, better to directly download latest updated version from Google Play Store directly5) Available RAM for use is only 3.2 GB due to too many unnecessary SAMSUNG APPS are not allowed to uninstall.It was my first and last mobile of NON STOCK ANDROID mobile, earlier used 5 stock android mobiles out of 6 gb RAM it provided 4.8 GB availablity and all non required apps can be deleted so purchasiñg ""Stock android"" mobile is only good option if want to purchase Android mobileDear Samsung - It was not your fault, I wasnt aware that purchasing NON Stock android will have additional mandatory apps of your company, Can you push OTA update for my device and make it stock android?

Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online

  Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

  There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.

Dont be hurry in buying for Samsung M31

  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.

Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....

  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price.

More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date.

The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

Okay, until this happened
","

  I can't believe within a month the phone screen started showing lines.19/05/2020 May Update: Went to the service center in Delhi and the lady and the manager said I'd need to pay if anything is broken. What's the warranty for? I asked what's the ""Gorilla Glass"" for if it couldn't handle a pocket fall (which is what they said happened)? And their reply, ""We are insiders. So we understand these things, there's no such thing as ""gorilla vorilla"" it's a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you'll have to pay for this.""I can't believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this ""insider"" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.7 april 21: working fine as of now.

Not worth it..
","

  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

The best phone money can buy at this price
","

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀

Super Slow Camera, Big Battery & Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna
","

  I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k

  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.

Samsung phones have signal strength issues
","

  I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc

  Great phone. There is no overheating like others say. For the price you getting a quality phone with massive battery life.Here are the pros:-Good qualityExcellent displayExcellent batteryBest cameraHere are the cons:-Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at allHeadphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby AtmosCharging speed is ok, not fast nor slow. It took 2hrs to fully charge. It's fast for 6000mahCamera app need a redesignAside all this.. it is the best phone under 15k.Go for it.

Amazing phone!
","

  The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price. According to my analysis, M21 is a good by at 12699/-.

  At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc.. If you are a non gamer, go for it...Only problem i faced is delay in delivery (almost 10 days).

   I Ordered this product on 28th july 2020 and recevied the delivery packet by 30th july 5:00pm (Delivery speed was good though.)I payed the order amt to delivery guy and after receiving the payment, he handed over me the phone. And full of curiosity i opened the delivery packet in front of  delivery guy.what i found is that phone box has all the accessories perfectly But the sad part is phone itself was missing.I mean did i just paid 13999 rupees for a samsung charger and a data cable and ofcourse the sim ejecting tool.Just warning you guys , maybe you won't even get the charger , data cable and sim ejecting tool .Be Careful While paying at this Product or even any other product from Amazon.So, this is the real face of amazon india services . this is their customer satisfaction and after sales service.I dont know that who was faulty at this , it can be the seller , delivery agency , or warehouse staff(as it was FBA product) . But the responsiblity of managing all of this goes to Amazon Only and that's why they charge high comission fees from sellers.

Nice phone with a bad processor
","

  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved

Honest Review of Samsung galaxy m21.
","

  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till now🤞🤞🤞10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.👍👍👍

Issues with wi-fi calling, battery, fingerprint sensor etc.

  Everyone is removing Chinese products from their life and hence I also planned to throw Xiaomi from my gadget and start using Samsung from now onwards. I further thought to convince my friends & relatives to use Samsung gadgets instead of Xiaomi. But after purchasing Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon which was delivered on 30-05-2020, my whole enthusiasm went in trash and I am helpless to compare it with my last handset Redmi 8 which was valued just Rs. 7,999/- as compared to Rs. 12,699/- of Samsung Galaxy M21. I don’t want to compare Samsung with Xiaomi handsets, but now realize how Xiaomi has captured Indian market in short span of time, surely because of quality & performance of their gadgets.I am trying Amazon customer care since 01-06-2020, but unable to connect and no response from their side. Below are serious issues found in just 2-3 days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 :• While using wi-fi calling feature, outgoing calls & receiving of SMS gets completely barred• While using wi-fi, HD call gets stopped• Whole battery gets drain in just 6-7 hours, not upto 6000 mAh handset performance.• Fingerprint sensor is very weak, it takes 3-4 times for login• Dual apps feature is limited for few applications only• Voice recording feature needs improvementPlease support in getting this issue resolved at the earliest.

A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain. (Only finish).One of the main problem I face is the search button for contacts. It is placed in a corner and that too very small. And if I search a contact. After few days if I open contacts again, what I searched will still remain there. I have to go all the way back to search again.

Amazing, definitely!
","

  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!

Too Early to Rate but had a bitter experience on the Product, already!
","

  Guess it was a problem with the seller, and not the product. The seller just delivered a used product with loads of defects. The camera was not functioning, the torch was not functioning and there could be more defects. I was just checking the item the moment it was delivered and encountered with these two defects. Upon unboxing, I found that the phone had a tempered glass already fitted to it. Initially I overlooked this but later realized that someone who had purchased it invested on the glass (and may have used it for a couple of days) with the defects before finally rejecting it. I think the M21 product should be fine and it is upon the seller who tried to strike a deal in such troubled times. So beware of the seller!

Excellent call quality and network reception
","


  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.

  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it's a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can't tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it's own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn't have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it's that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it's fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it's the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen's and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM's software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it's nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10's stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI's.battery:- it's a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason ""because Samsung thinks we are a fool"" it's a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don't know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it's camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it's a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it's a plastic phone and have plastic's quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it's a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it's fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don't select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don't play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!

My first android was Samsun and the new one too. Am too excited abt using this new watta monster with 6000 battery life and 48mp camera.

AWESOME PHONE FOR THE PRICE, BUT NOT FOR PUBG LOVERS
","

  No doubt i am loving Samsung m 21 4/64, which i ordered on 25th may, got delivered on 27th may. One thing to consider, this smartphone excels in display, camera quality and battery life...Processor is not that  powerful or not even close to sd 675 in terms of gaming. I have to use gfx tool, lowering resolution( less than hd) and other graphics stuff to Low with fps set to ultra(40fps). By applying this gfx tools settings i can play Pubg hell lot better with stable 30-40 fps. Dont try extreme,fps will be very unstable. With stock Pubg settings i am facing tremendous lags, stutters and fps drops even in the lobby, Cant say about 6/128 gb model. Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only. My verdict if u are not too much into gaming, Play clash of clans, or can adjust to above settings of Pubg, Go ahead to buy,  If pubg is top priority go with Vivo U20/Realme 6/Redmi note 9.

  Samsung M21 is  Manufactured in India and even brand is from S.Korea. I am very happy to move my mind from ""Xiaomi/mi to Samsung"". This is not a war, lesson for China :)I have pledge to boycott all China products!Here is the review:Good phone with long battery life, the feeling of touch is amazing. Value for money.

Wise Choice of an ""All Rounder"" Smartphone - Heartful review - Vera Level Phone
","

  No wonder why Samsung is the most used & most loved smartphone brand in the world! This is my first Samsung phone and I exchanged my previous damaged phone online for 2k.After spending one whole month in researching the best phone under 15k, I finally got it figured out and chose Galaxy M21. And Youtube videos and comments helped me take the wise choice. I got the deal (4gb 64gb) at Rs.13,500 and got it delivered in 6 days.Plenty of reasons why I chose M21:Will to honour our country heroesMonster BatteryGreat Display (feels like you are also present in the movie)Trust in Samsung Brand NameBetter CameraLesser weight (a boon for long time gamers)Polycarbonate back (safe against drops)Premium look rather than Fancy Nancy cheap plastic bodyType C ChargerThe Processor Debate:To those who wonder the same as I did (If we can play Pubg smoothly),The honest answer is YES. Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can't say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too. So i easily charge every night before going to sleep and turn it off in middle of night.Super Tips for Common Problems in All PhonesUpdate OS to avoid heating & restart issue (which happens not only in M21 but even in 60k phonesNever use a phone cleaner or battery saver app. Use the inbuilt power saving option.Turn off Bluetooth, Location, etc when not neededDon't charge even after reaching 100%Close apps when not needed, especially close all when playing game (and also enable gaming mode)Uninstall least used appsWhoever reads this comment can trust me and click the Amazon ""Buy Now"" button without any fear because this is the ONE perfect-ish smartphone under 15k category.Friends.... this phone feels like you hold jewel in your hand .

  19 July 2020, 1:45AM : This product has some ""MAJOR NETWORK ISSUES"". None of the SIMs (Jio, BSNL, Idea) are getting network on the phone (-113dBm 0 asu).

BEST MID RANGE SMARTPHONE ON THE PLANET EARTH
","

  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn’t try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that’s just fine. Let me be clear: I don’t have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn’t feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone’s battery lasts for so long, you don’t want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone’s battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn’t annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don’t try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won’t get a great camera system, and that’s one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That’s not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn’t too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21’s 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that’s not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there’s a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.

Good camera, better battery life, best display & doesn't lag
","


  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   CAMERAThe camera setup takes fine pictures in both natural and artificial lighting conditions. The 48MP sensor does take sharper images but lacks advanced HDR although in 16MP mode HDR works great. On zooming it doesnot take decent shots, just oversharpen the images and bumping the contrast. The wide angle 128° is awesome with wide dynamic range the pics are excellent although this lens struggles in moderate to low light scenarios.This phone takes decent videos all the way upto UHD 4K. The video stabilization is phenomenal. Although when using super steady mode you can't use wideangle or zoom lens and also it crops in a bit but overall a solid camera. The 20MP front camera takes average selfie but great videos. Also night mode is a fraud. Night mode doesn't work.DISPLAYThe super amoled display alone is the reason why I'll recommend this phone to everyone. It's stunning, colour accurate, sharp & crisp, and also emit less blue light so gentle on eye too.SOFTWAREAndroid 10.0 operating system with one UI 2.0 is fast & fluid and it stays like that. It doesn't lag now and it doesn't lag in future. The one UI skin is extreamly functional and fluid. IT DOESN'T LAG. It comes with loads of pre-installed apps but 90% of them can be manually uninstalled or disabled so no big deal. Timely monthly updates and one major OS update. KNOX is not there in this phone but thats fine in general samsung software is one of the secure software in android realm.PERFORMANCEThe exynos processor is somewhat comparable to snapdragon 660 and handles games and everyday tasks with breeze. Although sometimes framerates fluctuates in heavy games like call of duty and similar games. But for 95% of the times this processor will excel at whatever you throw at it.BATTERYThe battery life is great. I'm having about 8-9 hrs screen on time with auto brightness on and mobile data on all the time with moderate usage and some games & navigation along the way. 15w fast charging takes about 2.5-3 hrs to charge it up.MISCELLANEOUSThe fingerprint reader works fast & fine. Bottom speaker is not too loud but sound doesn't crack in high volume. The earpiece is adequately clear and audible. The build quality is excellent too having no flex. The USB-C port is nice upgrade. With 0.468W/Kg SAR Value it's very safe phone radiation wise.

  First of all this is the best value for money . For 5000rs I got decent smartphone, good headphones, cover, screen guard. The phone is having reasonably fast response (maybe not the best in class but decent).  I have installed about 20 apps like whatsapp, gpay, paytm, adobe reader, facebook, gaana etc and I didnot face any hanging issues, no battry heatings even after prolonged use. The battery itself last for 2 days of intense use. Cant ask more for the money. It maynot handle games but for the rest you cannot beat this. All the criticism here is from the chinese chamchas. Made in india for me always over some cheap chinese crap.

Good in the price range. But don't expect high performance
","

  It is the enterprise version I bought on 14 aug ,2020 for my father. After using the phone I think the phone is bit slower. This phone is not recommended for young generation. The click response time is bit slow. When I was first time setting up the phone and it was updating all the apps and the system update was running at the same time, the phone was very slow. But after all updation done it is working fine . If you want to buy it for parent or any old person with basic smartphone feature then go for it. This is a better phone than other phone brands available in this price range.

It is Eluga i7 ENTERPRISE EDITION. And therefore different from Eluga i7
","

  This is the worst possible phone. First of all it is not Eluga I7 it is Eluga I7 ENTERPISE EDITION and that makes all the trouble. Since it is the so called Enterprise Edition you don't get and accessories which fits this useless phone. Neither a good screen guard nor a proper flip cover. Lot of issues cloning data from another phone. In all a horrible experience with this phone. This is even before I actually start using the phone. Fingers crossed hoping I don't meet with any more troubles. But don't reccomend this phone to anyone.

  Phone has good looks, sufficient specs but works very slow and somewhat equivalent to 512 mb ram old phone, after touching any icon when no app running in background takes 3 seconds min to respond.

  Not a good product. I feel Volume control button is at wrong place. Due to which when we receive call if our finger touches it ring volume will go to mute. Screen hangs often. Unlocking won't happen. We need to press power button three or four times to get response. Charging port was very tight, because of this it got broken slightly  within a week. Charging has become an issue. Service centers are only two in big city like Bengaluru. Imagine about other places. Very bad product by a great company.  They have failed to deliver a product with minimum qualities.

  The phone is alright. The screen quality is bad. Can't set up any image as wallpaper, as most just make the screen look distorted/pixelated.

I had no camera requirements, so the poor camera isn't a problem for me. If someone just wants to keep a secondary phone or a phone for rough use, can buy it (with no high expectations in mind).

I have logged in for refund 7 times and made calls thrice but goes automated voice response wherein did not get a solution. The mobile is hanging continuously. The person who came to check could not provide any support

  Honest review after a week of usage -Do not make the mistake of buying this mobile. While the price point is competitive, it would make lot of sense to pay an extra 1000 and go for the Redmi Note 9 instead of Redmi 9 Power.This mobile has pathetic camera quality. It says 48 MP camera, but the quality is as good as 8 or 13 MP camera. Redmi note 9 having the same camera gives far better quality images. I am truly disappointed with the camera quality.So do not go on the Megapixels. This mobile honestly has very bad camera quality.The performance is OK. A snapdragon octacore processor does not do any justice as I have experienced good amount of lags while opening basic apps.The battery back up is good, but apart from that, there is nothing special about this phone.I regret buying this in the flash sale.

Roughly after one month use
","

  After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side.

Cons are so frustrating that amazon have now blocked giving direct reviews of this phone it seems. only genuine buyers can review it.pros:dual speaker, HD clarity on netflix n amazon primecons:1.camera takes literally 7secs to open (before installing extra apps on mobile itself),2.if u open netflix etc forget that it opens any other app without 10secs lag. so horrible i have never seen.3.third point is camera quality.. please don't buy seeing details on paper for this phone.4.memory management is so horrible that any app u open n switch to other app even for 3secs,it'll close old app i mean MIUI will literally kill ur apps so that you have to wait for double lag on ur screen.Last mobile I bought from xaiomi. it broke the real fans with this mobile basically.6.lastly, it doesn't have notification light which exists in 4year old phones from redmi series.verdict is.. just don't get into trap seeing details and numbers of this phone. it can't even handle basic functionalities without lag. maybe MIUI 12 is too bulky on this worthless piece.

Overall a budget phone with lots of bloatware
","

  Using this phone since a month and some of the key features are missing and facing other issues with MIUI12.Pros:  1)Good battery backup, but charging from 95% to 100% will take longer in the end.  2)Non-slippery and sturdy build quality  3)Comes with pre-applied screen guard which is still working fine.  4)Good sound qualityCons:  1)There is no Notification light, when you are charging there is no indication that it is even charging or fully charged.2) There is no notification light for any alerts which you receive, when you keep the phone for charging or when you receive any sms, missed calls, etc. You will have to unlock the phone and check the notifications.3) The camera quality is OK. You will have to learn how to use quad cameras properly via youtube videos.4) When you enable FingerPrint, Password lock, then Google backup stops working. This is major issue in this phone.5) The local MIUI backup for call history, sms history  doesn't work at all and it fails continuously. I showed it to the MI retailer shop and also to the customer care, even after 2 factory resets, this feature doesn't work. The only way to backup call history, sms history is via Google backup. But for google backup to work you have to disable Fingerprint lock. So, overall a bad backup experience in the current MIUI 12.0.6.06) Comes with lots of un-removable MIUI bloatware. I removed them manually via XDA tool on PC, apps like MiPay, MiCloud, Wellbeing, Mi Credit, Facebook, etc. A non-technical user or elders will have to live with all the bloatware of MIUI which shares your personal data with external applications by default. Better to watch some tips and tricks online and disable them.

But today's generation boys make me feel my mobile is old and internet speed isn't great because of old device and neeneed to look for new mobile. And I asked to go for this redmi. I was 90% sure I will go with Samsung again but they made me to belive Redmi is better than Samsung.Now the story begin. It's absolutely scrap. Redmi might compete with anyone but they aren't great. My internet speed remain same as I use to have on years old Samsung. Samsung nevers hangs in 5 years, but this mobile hangs frequently. I m irked customer of Nokia which troubled me after 1 year use  but this mobile irk just after 20 days.Photo quality I beluve J7 5 year old mobile camera us equally good than this 48 mp camera.Connecting headphone is headache. I have 2-3 google meet a day, now I always connnect with Laptop as this mobile burn my fingure to connect hard or to stress hard to keep connecting headphones.The day received I have trouble but Amazon denied to replace or return back saying this mobile is perfectly ok just by installing a app on your mobile and fool you to belive mobile is ok. After hard argument they suggest to contact Redmi service center. On the name of Replacement it's trap. But it at your risk.Don't get trab of young generation promoting redmi to buy because only if camera. Choice is yours, you buy it's for calls or camera.Lastly this mobile keep on promoting to download all useless app like play rummi, moz, chat share many many more. It's already have plenty of useless and harmfull preloaded apps. I dosent understand is this Redmi owned by single management. Everday same usless apps are recommend to download again and again. It's junk box. Good buys to redmi forever and byby to Amazo  for never I will buy mobile on Amazon.

  Bad news for selfie lovers, worst quality of front camera. It was not expected from MI. Phone is litil bulky because of 6000mh battery. Rest everything is good at this price range. Go for it if you are not a selfie lover.

  It seems like purchased a used mobile phone, looks wise its good but when it comes to camera then I gave 2 out of 10, the front camera is like useless, it remembers you a VGA type camera quality. Come to main camera, it's quality also not satisfying me. What my finding is, if you are going for this budget then go for Redmi Note 8, it far better than this one.....

Not for power users
","

  It's a good phone with horrible software. Here are some fixes.1. Ads - use Blockada to block all MIUI ads and trackers. This is free and does NOT require root. As a personal preference I also use the Nova Launcher to make the phone's UI look more polished and close to stock Android.2. Phone recording - This is an absolutely stupid inconvenience that Xiaomi shoved into their phones which nobody asked for. This phone uses Goggle Dialer meaning you can NOT discreetly record all your calls and the phone will play an alert saying This call is being recorded'. In my opinion, this is the worst thing about this phone because it is unfixable without rooting it. Every other xiaomi phone lets you use the miui dialer with the built-in discreet automatic call recorder. NOT THIS ONE. I hate this and hope xiaomi fixes this with a software update.3. Camera quality: It's not bad, it's actually pretty good for the price. But you can get way better photos by using the G-Cam APK. Google 'Gcam for Redmi 9 Power'. At the time of writing, the gcam port does not support video.Other annoying things that can't be fixed via software:1. Lack of LED light2. Imbalanced speakers. The bottom speaker is way more powerful than the top, this makes the stereo effect super annoying, even though a lot of paid YouTubers would have touted it as a feature. It gets annoying unless you're holing it in a way that amplifies the top speaker. This can be mitigated a little by messing with the equalizer, but that sounds like too much work unless you're willing to mess with it every time you plug in your headphones.3. My screen protector came pre-applied, but it was off-center. My eyes have gotten used to it, but that was a horrible first impression.4. It's made by a Chinese company.Positives:1. Nice bang-for the buck.2. Great in-hand feel3. Long-lasting battery4. Has IR blaster which is handy sometimesNeutrals1. The Redmi logo is big, but it's hardly visible. I can only see it under a specific light. Otherwise it's fine. I'd prefer if they were more classy about it along with being subtle.I can't recommend this phone to most people because of the voice recording / google dailer mess. Otherwise this would have been a good phone. I don't regret buying it, but it doesn't make me happy that i bought it.

  Overall I'm not satisfied with the product. Even if it have a good processor but the day to task is very laggy. I can't run some simple games like Candy Crush without lag. It hangs a lot. I have purchased the mobile for my mother but it's a disaster.Camera is also average even if it has a 48mp camera. Photo output is soft. It definitely require to improve the image processing.Only in the battery part it gives satisfactory results.Overall UI is also lagging a lot. Definitely not expected from Redmi to provide the product with so many problems.

  You will always feel bulky. I find below cons1. Too bulky, specially I feel bulky because I moved from Iphone 6 to this phone. Please check weight and dimension if it suits.2. It has a protective film on-screen which is useless. U soon need a screen protector when u buy.3. Bluetooth is the worst. I keep on reconnecting with my Garmin watch. However, it was no that condition with my iPhone.4. Battery life is good. It is a type C charge but takes time to full charge. More than 2 hrs.5. The box has a transparent back cover.6. Photography is average. My iPhone 6 with 8 MP was similar of this 48 MP camera.

Good Product with Reasonable Features
","

  Bought this device to my mom and used this device for a week before writing this review.Personally I found this device is good.Hardware:--I found that the camera quality is not up to the mark, can't expect more in this price range.--Fast charging working good and takes around 1hr and 40 mins to charge from 0 to 100--Fingerprint sensor there is a small delay when compared to other mobile phones at this price range.--Battery is really good, though there are a few reviews mentioning that the battery isn't good, I didn't face much issues with it. It easy survived for more than 40 hours after using some basic apps like WhatsApp, YouTube, Prime Video and Spotify.Software:--The UI seems good, except some apps which keeps crashing every time. (Requires a software update to avoid that)--Experienced no Lag when switching between apps or while using apps.Over all this is a good device at this price range. Definitely not recommended if you use many apps and install heavy games, as many apps crash while using. Can gift it to parents who doesn't use many apps or can be used as a secondary mobile phone.

Best in this price range.  Go for it
","

  I am writing this review after a month.Just loved the phone man. I just can't believe that I got this phone at such a great price. 48 MP Quad cam setup is extremely powerful to get those crystal clear photos with sharp quality. 6000 mAh battery literally stays for 1-2 days even after extreme usage and 2-3 if we use only for calling and WhatsApp and with the 18W charger in the box is amazing as it just takes much less time compared to its battery lifespan. The speakers are much louder and sound like a home theater. The processor is awesome for gaming on medium graphics and good for high graphics for sometime. The gorilla glass is literally hard like a gorilla because I just mistakely dropped my phone 1-2 times from a human height without case and screen guard then too not a single scratch appeared. This display and screen is also too good.Conclusion -: If you want to buy a awesome phone with a decent and good gaming processor in budget then must go for it.

The best thing is, I bought this phone using amazon paylater for zero emi for three months.

Great phone.... for basic use
","

  Superb battery backup, till now no hanging issue noticed. Very good mobile for the basic users. Camera quality is average and u can see noise in the picture taken. Finger print sensor & facial recognition works well even with mask on. No issues with the mobile network & 4G data connectivity, data reception is very good. But WIFI part works slow with 75 to 90 mbps line showing on other handsets & laptop, this mobile will show only 10 to 11 mbps max.Overall good mobile for basic user.

IDEAL FOR BASIC USERES
","

  I bought it for my mother, she uses to make video calls and surfing YouTube. Ideal for basic use. The pricing could be 1k less for this kind of configuration. Over all good product if you are not going to play games and keep cleaning junk from your phone. Like other vivo phones it also has unwanted advertisements.

Disappointed.
","

  The phone was for my wife who broke her previous Android phone.Pros-Nice screen, good resolution and brightnessBattery last about a day and a halfConsLot of bloatwareThe default screen background is pale grey and the phone's text shows up in a darker grey. Looks classy but difficult to read esp. outdoors.They have crammed in too many functions so the system seems complicated to use and some functions/features which were on the Motorola with an older version of Android, or my OnePlus 5T appear not to be available..... or we have not been able to discover it inspite of trying!The hardware is good for the price. Ease of use is the problem. Would not have purchased if we knew.

  This product is absolutely beautiful. I was quite sceptical at first about buying this phone. But when I got it,It was beautifu. So what if it has less reviews. If your budget is under 10K go for it. The dual camera is one of the best features.

Fair deal by brand samsung
","

  I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍

I then received the replacement piece. Camera was working this time but after 1 day use, I noticed that nobody called me the whole day when I generally receive around 10 calls. When I tried calling from another number, it said that the number is out of coverage area when jio had good network reception and VoLTE was on. I have a placed a return request for second time now.

","

  So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it.

Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit.

Fair deal by brand samsung
","

  I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍

3.5 star. Good enough.

  So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination.

Samsung should recall this model M02

  Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this.

  First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor.

Missed charging the phone ? Not a problem for this hand set !
","

  The RAM could have been 4 GB instead of 3 GB, which could make this phone, a leader in the segment.User friendly functions which can guide the elderly to use this phone effortlessly - is a key attribute of this hand set. There is a lag in response that is encountered at times, and that may be due to its processor. Overall, a phone with a better utility value.

Amazon Service was good
","

  Bought it with exchange and I really love the experience. It was quick and very easy. Amazon really care for your privacy :) . I bought it for my dad and he is very comfortable using it. Just one thing I got to compromise is there is no fingerprint sensor. Rest all is good for an average mobile user. I don’t recommend it for gamers. But highly recommended to anyone who loves to use a branded phone with in budget .

Hangs too much, worst software from Samsung
","

  It's been just 3 months and this mobile is hanging very often. I installed only 3 apps Whatsapp, Prime video, and FB lite and It can't even handle 3 apps. I can't take calls it stops while getting a call. Worst software from Samsung. The camera quality is also too bad, pictures are too dark taken from the rear camera. I also bought Galaxy M31s with 8GB & 128GB for 20 k, i don't use many apps, my RAM is 3.5 GB filled remaining 4.5 GB free, and still, the Galaxy M31s too hangs a lot. I don't think buying Samsung mobile is not a good idea

Beware of heating
","

  Within 2 days of ordering,received the phone,,simple to set it up but there is definitely an issue of excessive heating when watching a video or youtube,amazon's return policy is a simple efficient procedure and I got the phone replaced within 2 days of return.Replaced phone still has heating issue not to the extent of earlier one.So continuing to use but not very happy,even the software is a bit slow,,disappointed Samsung is peddling a low grade product,,my reason to stick to Samsung is all other phones in this price range Rs7999 which I paid are all chinese variety..If samsung continues to peddle low quality cheap phones manufactured out of their factory in India,more and more customers with reluctance will switch back to chinese..shame..Thumbs up for Amazon,,thumbs down for Samsung

Nice Budget Phone
","

  I have bought this phone for our office staff use and I find it quite good. Although the phone body is made of plastic but I think in this budget you can expect metal body and sturdy phone construction.I really feel bad when I open the phone as there is no Back Cover and Tempered glass is being provided with the phone. Because the phone is just launched stage, so there is non-availability of the back cover in the market and ultimately I had to pay 50% extra to buy the cover online.Rest if you talk about performance : its OK at this price ranger where in there is 3 GB RAM, you can not expect more than this at this processor and hardware installation.About Display: I am satisfied with the display part.Overall: I am satisfied at this price range.

  I booked within 15 minutes of launching on 9th February 2021. I am writing this review after using three weeks. I was expecting something better than m10 but this time Samsung disappointed its users. It's mediatek processor makes it too slow to even perform daily task.Battery is good. Handset is slim and a little bit longer than m10 and others which suits on its slim body and gives you better grip in your hand. Camera quality is same as m10.

  If you see the price the phone is worth at this price. I was expected more from Samsung in this phone. Lagging in multitasking. 3gb ram is good but need to improve processor. Updates are good. Camera quality is as similar as basic phones. Macro mode primary. Dont know why there is Micro usb port, hence my other Samsung mobiles having type c. Charger is 1.5 it should be 2.0. No headphones in pack. Data cable is very short. No screen guard. No silicon cover.I purchased for my son. Initially it will be used for zoom meeting and games. But with this processor it is hard to play games like freefire, coc, COD is impossible to play.Otherwise it is good for surfing, calls, battery life, normal video calls (no HD).

Average Product!!! Think Again!!!!
","

  If you are going to buy a phone which comes without headphones, fingerprint sensor, average camera performance & slow at speed FOR this much of money then you have find the best deal. Overall, its a very ok-ok device from every aspect and I think does not value for money . Rest is upto you.

Worst Production of Vivo so far. Very slow charging, Too fast draining. Piece of crap.
","

  Worst product of vivo so far... It takes 4 hours and 26 minutes to get fully charged from 30% to 100%.. Very disappointing product. Oppo A1k is much more better in this price segment. I lost trust on Vivo after buying such a product. I am sharing the picture of the phone which I recieved day before yesterday.

  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000

Good Phone at 9k
","

  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000

Value for money. Buying Samsung product is contributing for innovation!
","

  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define ""Normal"". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)

  Don't buy any Mobile from Amazon if you are not fully aware abaout the product. After buying they are not entertain you for returning/replacement.

Only samsung mobile left in market if you don't want to buy any Chinese mobile. Not a single Indian mobile available in own Indian market.Samsung making good money with its cheap quality mobile phones.

  Not worth the price at all! I am writing the review after using 17 days!Pros.1. Handy piece tho a bit heavy it's good to operate.2. Front camera is cool.3. Good face lock AI.Cons.1. Worst camera ui and I don't think this time samsung has their quality over the camera the back camera is worst.2. Not a worthy battery life.3. Too highly priced.Totally I'm not satisfied!It's better to buy any other model other than this. If not the new realme model is of the same price almost of this and has super good features. You can choose that or any other model from Samsung itself but don't choose this model coz there are lot of flaws in this... so its not worth the price.Hope my review helped..

  Bought this one on 25th August, reviewing on 22nd September.Battery life with a pocket friendly size is the only good thing about this phone! The headphone jack is behaving so erratically...it automatically reduces or increase the volume of audio/video being played and despite pressing hard on the keys or trying different earphones, the problem persists...even after a factory reset.Also, the charging socket has stopped working properly, so now I have to place my phone at a specific angle or keep holding in my hands in that position while charging the phone!Screw you Amazon...7 days replacement policy is just not good enough!

branded value for money phone having Better quality than china make
","

  Samsung M series, great phone in this range all are value money. Let's see here the SAMSUNG M01 phone: red colour , thin design make gives beautiful phone look. It has optimised performance with low power consumption that's gives you longer battery life time. It does not have finger tip sensor, bought it for grand parent who do not actually need it, some time in emergency you don't wish to have these security features.  At this budget with exchange offer got a great deal a brand new phone with loaded feature at 6500, isn't good. Front camera is average, clarity is good however back dual camera is good, inbuilt animated shot can give you different experience. The phone having good voice and sound quality, inbuilt and expendable memories are now improved than older phones gives you the freedom to be entertain. I love the display quality of samsung this is unmatched feature. Phone size is small and compact so can easily carry it in pockets, or keep it with other phone if you keep two phone.If want to have phone at low budget or secondary phone for back- up with reliable brand it's a good choice.ver all it's a great quality branded value for money phone.

Good phone . DON'T BUY IT.
","

  This phone is meant for a very small group of people. First of all, it is a very small display compared to other flagship or even other low budget phone . The only reason one should buy this is either they love Samsung ui - android 10 or they need a backup phone with very less radiation. The snapdragon 400 chip set is a very outdated chip which does not provide even close to the performance from other phones from this range. Well , after this you might think that the camera might be great. Wrong again , the 8 mega pixel camera can maximum take photos uptown 4 mp(which is not of even good quality either) and the front facing camera is just trash.Talking about spec sheet, out the the 32 GB, you only get 20. And out 3GB ram , there is only 1.5 GB ram which you can use. Running simple applications take about 2.5 GB ram.Battery is decent(finally something good about the phone) but it will ofcourse be so ,as there has been compromises is every other part of the phone.  In the box comes a 5 watt charger which takes ages. At an age where phones can charge uptown 100 watt, it's totally unfair that samsung gives us 5 watt charger. There is no inbuilt screen protector or back case.The dual camera setup is just for name sake. Please don't buy this phone for the camera or performance.Like I said earlier,  this phone is useful for old grandparents or children with limited usage. With is budget,  you can get better phones such as narzo 10a or oppo phones which are better and give relatively good performance too.The phone doesn't lag much but due to the small screen , online class or videos will be hard to attend. If in case you plan to buy this phone , try contacting a physical store as they can give you a better price. Another problem I noticed, the charging cable is smaller than the normal size. Makes it difficult to charge.

An average Smartphone
","

  Overall it's an average Smartphone.I would tell you about some basic parameters.PERFORMANCE- This Smartphone is having an average Processor. So, don't even think of playing heavy games like COD or PUBG. But if you are buying for normal usage than it works quite well but lags sometime as it has 3GB RAM.CAMERA- It has a decent rear camera. Depth sensor is on average and clicks normal portrait shots. Front camera is below average so don't expect much from it.BATTERY- It has 4000 mAh battery so if you have a normal usage then it works easily for 12-15 hours once it is charged 90%. One problem is that it comes with a 5V/1A Charger so it takes much time to get charged.One more thing is that it doesn't have finger print scanner.It has face unlock that works quite well.At last I would say if you want to buy a non-chinese smartphone and your budget is around 8.5k-9k then you can go for it. This phone is for moderate use and from my view it will easily work for 3-4 years. And if you want gaming or better specs then either you go for Chinese phones or make your budget large.

Great for daily basic usage.
","

  DISPLAY: The TFT Display quality is good compared to other cheap brands, the viewing angle is also good, does not fade out much when you view it from different angle. Brightness is also sufficient.BATTERY: Battery life is very good. Hours of basic usage (online classes, calls, whatsapp, browsing) and hours of gaming. Using since 15 days, not found unnecessary battery drainage.CHARGING: It's little slow if you are used to a 10W of a fast charging mobile. 1% increment in charge takes 2 minutes and 10-15 seconds approx. But mobile does not heat at all during charging.PERFORMANCE: Zero lag during web browsing, youtube, switching between apps, online classes via skype, zoom & google meet. One UI is really very smooth. I don't play pubg, but it's easily playing games like ""IAF:A cut above"" in ultra graphic settings with no lag or frameskip.CAMERA: The major issue with this mobile is it's camera image quality in low light condition, it's very poor in low light (without flash) but with flash its ok ok type. However the back camera quality in day light or indoor light conditions is good, not soo good or bad, its just good. Selfie camera is not good at all. It needs softwere improvement.CALLS: Call quality is great and loud on both sides.CONCLUSION: If you need a compact, good looking, good in hand feel and durable non-chineese phone with basic to medium usage like online classes, low to medium intensity gaming and smooth ad-free Ui then definitely go for it. However if you want a camera centric phone taking pictures all the day and especially selfies, it's not for you.

  Its a value for money product from Samsung. Though I am not a big Samsung Fan however this model is a superb option when your pocket is tight on budget and you need a good quality smartphone. Phone build quality is sturdy and gives a nice feel in hand and looks good too ,Battery life is good , camera quality is sufficient, screen is good but no fingerprint reader. I really like the screen size (5.7) which is far better that the big phones (6.+ screen size) , because of bit small screen phone fits well in hand and gives the easiness to use with single hand. Samsung should have also provided at least a wired earphone with the phone (should not cost Samsung much) which is missing in the box.

  Samsung is just not able to deliver the quality the customer expect from it.There nothing good about this phone,Its slow, hangs if you download a few apps, even its not able to support half the capacity other phone of this range/memory/RAM can support.In just 30 days of delivery the phone showed a display problem, and when I visited their service centre, they said it will take at least 4 days to fix the display issue. Which I believe, if done outside wouldn't take more then 10 mins. And as per them you have to leave your phone with them for these 4-5 days when they will be ordering and arranging the display. As if you bought the phone for ur baby to play video games and you dont have any important needs from your smart phone.

  Given the price point .. you get best return for your money..Some things i dint like after a month of usage..The brightness cannot be lowered to readable degree .. so if you plan to read on this phone at night. You might find the screen to be too bright even with very low setting..Battery charges extremely slow.. you get a 5 watt chargerUse 10 watt to charge or else it take 2:30-3 hours to charge..But last almost more than a day..Games like pubg and pes .. run very well given its specs.Overall satisfied.Thank you

Unarguably the best non-Chinese phone for under ₹8k
","

  I bought this for my aunt. Performance is good actually. I’ve put lots of apps and the speed was good. Speaker is not that loud but for the price it is good. Camera is bad but for people not wanting it, it gets the job done! I’ve also bought M01 core (2GB) which is way inferior compared to this. M01 core’s camera is worse than this. For people using only Facebook, Whatsapp... M01 core would be fine but for a price difference of only ₹1900; M01 offers a lot more!

Disappointed
","

  Took 2 phones in my family. I did not want to buy a Chinese product so purchased Samsung. This phone doesn't catch the signal well compared to all our previous phones. We had great difficulty in answering calls in our home. It was noted that it does not switch to the 4G/3G/2G network appropriately and holds on to the 4G network even when the signal is extremely poor. To overcome this problem we had to use one sim to select network automatically and one sim with 2G network only.I personally use Nokia 6.1 Plus which is excellent in identifying appropriate network in the same room and with same mobile network. Also it is clean, better quality, and most importantly gets timely updates and does not lag even after 2 years.I used Samsung j7 previously and that also had similar problems and was dead slow within 2 years. Samsung should seriously work on this.Mobile is basically used for calls, camera, google maps, and games. Phone does not use the mobile network appropriately. Cameras are not competetive in the mid segment. Samsung does not provide compass in most of the mid segment phones apart from recent M series. Phones get dead slow and lag within one year. It has lot of unwanted apps just like another Chinese phone. Then what good is the brand value and after sales service for. Probably it is only focusing on their premium customers.

  Bought it in sale. Charger was missing at first. Then I returned and got a replacement. There is no option to return and get a refund, if we don't like. The phone takes long time to switch off and on. Though I called customer support and explained the issues, they said that there is no option to return it. Be very careful and read all the things while buying costly items. This phone is definitely a refurbished phone. Not working properly. I am not going to use it.

Like 2000 mh only.Takes 6 hours to charge 100% from 20 % of battery.Touch and disply excellent...Battery drains fast, even after keeping many apps sleep and complete off the background refresh. 8 hours of battery with constant use.

  Post 3 days of usage :Battery - Excellent battery backup (goes up to 2nd day effortlessly - gaming not included in usage).Charging - Fast charging is a miss vs competition brands but while using the device didnt feel it as missing since device sustains entire day smoothly so no probs.Built - Plastic built but from the looks alone it feels good (have a red one) not premium though.The size of the device makes it a superb grip and ease of use with single hand.Display & Touch - Display is small vs  competition. Colour/Brightness is decent enough; no complaints at all. Touch is buttery smooth.OS - Android 10 (though not stock android like Nokia) advantage against competition; very few devices below 10K giving Android10 as out of the box. One would experience it during daily usage.Camera - Worst of the lot i guess; shaky, noisy images and videos (rear and front both) .. it was a shock - Samsung should do something about it in the next s/w update.Except Camera rest the device is very good at the price point!

  So, still now all my phones have been ordered from different online platforms. Never did I face such an issue with any of the devices. Samsung M01, I ordered and delivery was done within 24hours.Now after using it for another 24hours, I find the phone heating up within 20-30mins of using internet. Or even a mere phone call is making the phone hot.I preferred Samsung over Redmi to avoid this heating issue. Moreover,right now... No heavy apps are installed in the phone as well.I called up amazon customer care service. They have fixed an appointment where a technician will visit me to check the phone. However, I'm not at all willing to use the phone anyone and whan to exchange it. The executive told me, that only after inspection they will be able to give me further status. However, I hope I have a good experience with Amazon service. Otherwise this will be definitely the end of my relationship with Amazon.

It's a camera rather a smart phone
","

  Hi guys,I from mumbai bought this mobile in October 2020. Thought it is not a Chinese mobile but ...I did not like the phone the camera images is nice but as a smart phone not at all.There are lots of glitches1. It is not have finger print reader. It has face reader sensors in that you have a problem in unlocking is that your face position and light on the face should be same while it was at the time of setting. So most of the time you have to go to pin no. you have set you press the right pin no. Then you have to press OK button also. Why the hell I press OK button if I press right pin no. This is not a sign of a smart phone?2. Another great disadvantage is this phone  doesn't support LED indicator for charging for a phone it is a must feature in day today life how come in the night you come to know that battery you kept for charging is charging for not some times cable gets loosen and a simple red light indicator tells us you need to charge mobile immediately. If this feature is not there how you will cop up day today function and what is more shocking it does not support either battery % sign along the battery sign for that you have manually drop down the notifications bar to see the % sign.3. No internet speed indicator in notifications bar. As well in options.4. No screen shot capture button in notifications bar as well in short button list. Only age old system for screen shot pressing power and sound button together. No option of  three finger scroll down like wise it tell that press palm side but it doesn't happen. More after taking the screen shot it goes in the gallery you cannot send the image directly.5. Another glitch is in phone numbers it self if you press phone icon then you have to choose you want a dial a pad or recently calls or contacts, in other mobiles you get list of recently dialed calls list along with dial pad. And the height is that if you press from resents calls inteasted of calling it goes another screen asking you want to call, SMS, what up ... rather then calling you have again have to press that calling button.6. While operating another glitch is,while watching jio tv or prime, when we press home the thing we are watching in jio or prime is still seen at the bottom left side of the mobile and you have to clear it and then again open the app.7. From 32 gb the internal software itself eats up 9 gb and when I installed my applications and When I updated phone version from that time the mobile gets slow in operating.THIS PHONE IS RATHER MORE OF CAMERA THAN A SMART PHONE.Updated on 27/11/2020This phone does not have magnometer aido so you can't have compass on this phone.This phone also cannot be use as a remote for AC, TV etc.This phone also have another glitch when you receive phone on WhatsApp and if your phone is off only bell rings it does not open the screen you to press the ON button then you have to press your PIN no to open mobile then WhatsApp to receive call by the time call goes off.

Good Small Phone
","

  For those who want a compact phone, this one is perfectly sized for one handed usage. Display is not that bad but little bit of light bleeding on the top and bottom corners. Maybe I also got a defective unit like many other. Samsung should do proper quality check. Sound is loud and crisp. Doesn't lag for day to day usage. Battery lasts a whole day if minimally used. The speaker is on the backside which is little disappointing as it is a backward design. If it had a fingerprint reader it would have been an awesome phone. Software gives peace of mind, no ads or bloatwares thanks to One UI. Overall my rating is 3.5/5.

  Like : Right now fast access, feather touch key, good camera and picture quality, excellent customer care and remote access of the phone.Dislike: Some important feature like 'Screenshot' is absent in scroll up menu that is to be brought from Accesibility option of setting and put on Assistant menu. Which should be a ready option in scroll up menus. Incoming phone call sound quality was very poor however that was resolved by guidance from Customer care by remote accessing.Battery life which needs to be more longer.

For people searching a Compact phone in 2021!

  Have been searching for a midrange phone but priority was for compact size. Except Apple and Google its almost rare to find a decent phone with display less than 6inch in 2021. The 5.7inch display phone is so comfortable to hold and for one hand use. The One UI looks clean and no unnecessary bloatwares. Next to Stock Android. Yes it misses out on fingerprint reader but has face unlock. No FHD Amoled/IPS Display but display quality and viewing angle is not bad. Also no Fast Charging. People who use phone just for calling, chatting and other normal usage this is pretty much value for money. Gave 5stars to support brands launching compact phones in an era of tablet sized phones.

Value for money

  Build quality is really good. I like Samsung Glance app showing news on our interests in the lock screen. My old phone had fingerprint sensor which is missing in M01 but face lock and unlock does the trick and works well. Likewise, I used android one UI in earlier phone. The only feature that i miss is swipe left from home screen to get Google news feed. But then again, its a software feature. My earlier phone was a 16K costing one and still it lasted only 1.5 years and i learnt that since the hynix eMMC used in device hit its lifetime, writes started failing and so phone became unusable. So, I wanted to buy Samsung this time as Samsung eMMC would be more reliable and would last longer. Snapdragon 439 SoC processor is just right enough for regular phone use. Camera still pictures would look super good provided person holds the phone still and even after clicking needs to hold the phone still for couple of seconds or else, the pic appears distorted. Would recommend this phone for sure as it is sturdy and very good value for money.

  I was pleasantly surprised to see on Amazon about the Samsung M01 available for the unbelievable price of Rs. 7499. I was looking for a phone for my wife. With the brand value of a company like Samsung, and with my experience with our Samsung phones which we have been using for few years without a hitch, I didn't have to look elsewhere to make the decision to go for it. I got a very good exchange value as well for the old Samsung phone.After using it for a week, I am very happy about the performance of the phone. With a 4000 mAh battery, it easily last for 2 days if you are not a heavy user. Display, camera and the UI are quite good. With Android10 and Samsung's OneUI core 2.0 it is a real bargain. It is an outstanding phone in this price range. Real value for money.

Super satisfied

  Reviewing the device after using it for more than a week. Find my pros and cons below:Pros:1. Battery: Battery backup is super impressive if you are a normal user. I don't play games but have to take calls through the day as I am working from home and I also use its hotspot throughout the day and the battery doesn't disappoint.2. Camera - I know that this is the new age of triple and quad camera setups in mobile phone but I have to say that even though I had very less expectations from the camera it does a wonderful job. The samsung camera app is superb and even though it has limited features it still performs fabulously in daylight and nicely in artificial or low light.3. One UI- The Samsung's very own android skin is amazingly cool and makes the user experience so much better.4. Display- Even though this is an LCD display still the colours are punchy and even in sunlight the display performs well.5. Biometric- The face unlock performs nicely and unlocks the device in a jiffy.You will not regret the absence of a fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Charger: As it is a 4000 mAh battery the absence of a fast charger is something that hurts. They could have included the 15 watt adapter that they offer with other devices.2. Case: Though not really a necessity, presence of a protective case would have been so much better.There aren't too many cons as this is a really good device for normal usage and you would be able to use it for all your essential needs for day to day basis.

Very poor and keeps disconnecting on fiber broadband.2nd problem is extremely slow charging.

  But there are some unexpected cons which weren't clear enough with the spec-sheets.1. There is no support for 5ghz wifi. You can neither connect to a 5ghz wifi nor create a 5ghz wifi hotspot. Being in 2020, I have taken it for granted.2. Samsung gallery doesn't have the sync option with OneDrive as S series. You are forced to use an older version of Samsung gallery on this phone. And if you want to sync, you better use google photos and Samsung gallery completely.3. You don't get a compass and magnetometer.3. Many preloaded apps, and some of them are not uninstallable notably, OneDrive and Netflix (you can only disable these).4. Default Weather app has ads and no way to disable it.

  For someone who is not a fan of oversized screen taking the whole space of your pocket, this is a boon from heaven. Before writing this review, I read a lot of negative comments vilifying the phone on its size and specs. Well let me tell you, in current times Samsung has conceived a very practical phone from its factories.Agreed, its camera while focusing gives a blurred and rather disturbed resolution but after clicking you get a finely processed image which looks as real as reality. Its camera specs are comparable to another cutie, the iPhone 6S.Would have loved an AMOLED screen and quick charging facilities (Type C) but then it would have added to the cost, losing its budget-friendly moniker.

  I just needed a smaller phone for day to day usage. These days all phones are over 6.5 inches so buying this phone with 5.7 inch low bezel display was a dream. It fits perfectly in hand and one handed use is very easy. Coming to the performance, the UI is very smooth. Apps open and close instantly and RAM management is also very good. You can easily rely on this phone for heavy tasks but it takes a hit from gaming as the GPU is not very strong. Gamers will also probably find it difficult to play in the smaller sceeen. The battery is very good and may also last upto 2 days with minimal use. Basically, if you want a handy phone with great battery life and performance for daily tasks like, YouTube, browsing, social media, etc then this is the way to go. The only cons in this phone is the camera which takes good photos only in broad daylight and slow charging

Samsung Galaxy M01 user review

  I am using this phone for more than a week now. I'll try to lay down the pros and cons.Pros:-* Perfect size, best for single hand use and also good enough for watching films and videos.* Battery life is decent, with moderate to slightly heavy usage it easily lasts for a day or more.* Android 10 from the box.* With3gb/32g it functions quite smoothly. No lags whatsoever.* The speaker sound is loud enough and clear.Cons:-* No fingerprint scanner, the face unlock doesn't work well. So you need to depend on pattern or pin unlock.* Doesn't support fast charging, takes around 3.5 hrs for full charge.Some othe points :-* The camera is definitely not the best in the budget but is ok considering the price point.* display isn't amoled but its again decent enough for the price.Finally i would definitely recommend this phone to the ones who are searching for phones in the budget segment with the brand assurance of Samsung and a single hand usable device.

  The Samsung M01 is like a breath of fresh air amid the big screen mobile phones. The phone is really handy with a great user experience. One can operate and carry it around with ease. In my opinion, this is the USP of the product.As far as the technical specifications are concerned, it will run most applications however it is unreasonable to expect heavy multitasking/gaming on the device. It's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 with 3GB RAM, the specification is outdated but it is good enough for most of your daily use. I didn't expect a smooth experience with these specifications but Samsung has done a brilliant job with the One UI 2.0.Apart from all the good reasons to buy the phone, the phone seriously lacks a good camera and a fingerprint reader. However, at this price point IMO this is the best phone, the tradeoffs are easily overcome by its handiness, experience and security features.

   Mobile quality n function is OK. But now a days companies providing charging cable much less from charger to phone. Not understand giving this much less cable. You can see in video the length of cable. Earlier I have used Panasonic Eluga Ray Max and its charging cable is sufficient and length having 42 inch (105) and present charges having 32inch(80cm).

Amazing M01 !!!!
","

  Very economical, an excellent phone for this budget.PROS...Since it is Android 10, we can apply dark mode and hence battery consumption is less.Also, even latest apps can be installed in this smartphone due to android 10.3GB Ram provides an excellent working condition to this phone. Even Pubg can be played in this phone without any sort of hang.Massive screen with infinity V display helps to see the online classes and movies very clearly.Dolby atmos provides an excellent utility to this phone. Even with a worthless earbud, by using Dolby atmos, it sounds good.It has a huge battery of 4000mAh and also massive  storage of 32 gb ram, which is worthy for a normal user.LAST but NOT LEAST, I'm very happy to hear that this is an INDIAN smartphone designed by INDIANS. Make in IndiaCONS...Even it has an octa core processor, its processor is very low when compared to redmi and realme phones in this price range.It does not have a fingerprint scanner, but has a fast face unlock.Even though it has a huge battery, it has a 2hrs charging time.So although it has some cons, it is a smartphone with many pros and some cons. I like it very much.What about you ???

Very satisfied; good no-frills and no-nonsense value for money
","

  Have been using it for last 3 weeks, and it meets every expectation I had when I purchased it. I was looking for:1. Small size... I.e. smaller than the 6+ inch screen which seems to have become the norm.2. Reliable non Chinese make3. Decent specs in terms of processor and RAM and battery (was not very particular abt the camera)4. Low price.. budget was 10 kAm unfortunately unable to take good care of my phones, and am also trying to reduce screen time.. so, this seemed overall to be the best choice available, and now I can say that it is the best choice available for someone looking for those things. It has seamlessly slipped into my usage without any fuss or trouble at all.

Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind
","

  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.

  Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.

  It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.

Don't look for Xiaomi with Helio chipset. Buy motorola E7 insted of this.
","

  Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience.

Redmi 9 disappointed me 😔😔.
","

  My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone.

Go for Redmi 8a Dual instead
","

  If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.

  Phone hangs so many times, switch off while using. watching video on YouTube, incoming call doesn't show but ringtone plays, camera quality average, phone performance is below average, battery performance is fine, Amazon services is poor, sends technician, he hard reset the phone then he checks it for 4 or 5 minutes and say it is ok, what if it's performance if you have to hard reset it 2 time during 7 days, because after hard reset every phone works perfectly for some times while technician checks it for 5 to 10 minutes.

Decent overall package for an entry level phone
","

  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks

Don't buy this phone 😞📱
","

  Writing Review after 1 month use:Over all mobile is quite good in this price range but camera quality is very poor.I would suggest don't buy this phone, go with Redmi 9 Note.Poor camera quality.Bettery life is very good.MIUI 12 (Android 10) is very good. Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.Screen quality is good.Finger sensor is very quick.Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor. If your phone has really any defact then only it will get replaced with same model. You can't return & buy another better model.

Good phone for beginners
","

  I bought it for my mother, and she is learning to use it. 4GB/64GB at this price is really good. Touch is very responsive and quick. Screen quality is little dull and sound output is low compared to other Redmi phones. Redmi needs to work on these for budget phones. Camera is average as it is not camera centered phone. Network reception and battery power is good, last for 1.5 days with normal usage. Overall good phone for beginners and elderly people to start with

Redmi 9 review.
","

  Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.

  Display better for this price but if you can spend a 1000 rupees more go for Redmi 9 Prime which has better FHD display and good processor than this.  Function is good especially for online classes and also the size of display is good for online classes. Games mild okay.  Camera is really bad in even very light conditions.  Good only in bright places and close-up shots. Overall 3.5 out of 5.

Please..... 🙏 don't Buy. Cheapest product from Mi👎Don't Believe in Paid Adverstiment

  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. 😞. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone 📱, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% 😀. The phone is too lightweight ☺️ and very handy😄 Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. 😃.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. 😭GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. 😠😠.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. 😥. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good 👍But it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. 😠Display quality is too poor. 😫 Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. 🥺  No led in front of the display.😰Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection 😥If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or above🤗 with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy.

  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!

Cons and Pros

  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ♥️ no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses

Points to be noted
","

  Points to be noted:👉 The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.👉 This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.👉 Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.👉 Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.👉 After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone.

  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐

  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done.

Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful..

But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money.

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.
","

  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't boot🥵Another round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN 😢😢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day❗Moral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier 🙏

  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance.

  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL.

  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs.

Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.
","

  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!

Nice Phone for doing normal works
","

  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh..

Durable phone, worth every single rupee!
","

  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru

DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED

  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product.

  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management
","

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

My Real Review - M31 is Average
","

  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.

Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product. Amazon has agreed post diagnosis saying its a faulty piece  but does not give refund

  One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand. Better to purchase any other brand except Samsung.1. Heating issue2. Second sim works on 3g.3. Even its 6Gb ram works like 2gb ram phone.When I called amazon customer care they said I have to go to service center for this and they are telling to check through app.Its a f***ing phone please please please don't waste your money.And this is my last ever purchase from amazon.

Too narrow and long. Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Average sound, defective piece.

  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highFingerprint reader too highHeats up a lot.Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.

  I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3.

HONEST REVIEW BY USER
","

  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)

  It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.

  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

Ok product for the price range

  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

  I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it

  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.Edit: After 9 months of usage: I am not facing the heating issues now. I had the heating problem while using hotspot for entire day. Battery backup is also good now. But facing some issues in camera. After the latest software update, the photos are some times showing our face like a black and white. This issue is happening only few times and the issue is on only around face. Complained to samsung but no action taken. They are asking for more logs from my phone. Other than this, phone is good to use.

For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR

  hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

  Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with ""6000 mAh"" monster battery, superb ""64 MP Quad Camera"", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

  After using one week i have these experience with Samsung Galaxy M31.Pros: Attractive design.Screen size is handy at 6.4 inch.Good camera,both selfie and main at 32mp and 64 mp.Cons:Phone is heating very much.It heats always when charging,gaming and using internet.Charging is very slow.Even it is having 6000 mah battery, it drains very fast.In standby position also it comes from 100% to 80% overnight.Very disappointing.If this is fixed after any updates I will update my review.After two weeks of usage I am updating.After writing to Samsung members they suggested me some changes in settings.Now my mobile performing well.After 2 months, again I am adding.After updating two times no heating issue.Battery lasts for two days even after full day use.Satisfied.

Great buy. Excellent camera and battery for this price.
","

  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

Disappointing 6000 mah battery & performance, but good amoled display.
","

  (After 2 months usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.Material is just not very good.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

Best in class, but with a few exceptions
","

  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

  Apart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP.

BAAP of Power and features
","

  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.
","

  A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

Battery consumption
","

  1) From 0 to 100% taking more than 2 hours.2) Battery consuption is high due to default SAMSUNG apps which cannot be deleted and also reducing performance.3) Not possible to Delete NETFLIX4) Even if you download any app from Samsung store you have to upgrade it through Google Play Store, better to directly download latest updated version from Google Play Store directly5) Available RAM for use is only 3.2 GB due to too many unnecessary SAMSUNG APPS are not allowed to uninstall.It was my first and last mobile of NON STOCK ANDROID mobile, earlier used 5 stock android mobiles out of 6 gb RAM it provided 4.8 GB availablity and all non required apps can be deleted so purchasiñg ""Stock android"" mobile is only good option if want to purchase Android mobileDear Samsung - It was not your fault, I wasnt aware that purchasing NON Stock android will have additional mandatory apps of your company, Can you push OTA update for my device and make it stock android?

  I saved money for 5 months and bought this phone about 25 days ago. First thing is you cant replace it after these days and now it is getting restarted in-between  i am working on it. Not just that , it does not turn on but only the samsung logo shows for 1-2 hours. Now you cant do anything. I went to service center . They kept this phone for 3 days and did nothing . They said to me to pick up my phone after all the data has been deleted and phone's has been reset . And the very next day , here I am with this same problem . I am regretting a lot with samsung . And cant just go to service center daily. Its 50 km far from my residence.

Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online
","

  Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

An underappreciated budget phone
","

  There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.

Dont be hurry in buying for Samsung M31
","

  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.

Samsung make fool to their customers in the name of warranty

  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....

Disappointing 64MP Camera!!!!

  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

  Do not buy this phone.Its display quality is very bad. My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?

This is an average phone just with battery backup only  and not great w r to speed and performance
","

  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

So we understand these things, there's no such thing as ""gorilla vorilla"" it's a normal mirror.

  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

  Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy

  Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it’s a Piece of shit.Kindly don’t buy Becoz it’s worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that’s all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don’t buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.

🙄Redmi changed lifestyle😎🤭🤷‍♂️
","

  I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.

  Best product for homeschooling students and this e who are new users. It's a great combo and manages every tasks vet well . The helio g85 chipset is almost equivalent to Snapdragon 712 . If you are a student and buying a new phone it's the no. 1 preference. Please don't listen to those who say this isn't a great phone . Believe me I have used it. Now if you are planning to play games more than 2 or 3 and pubg. Hours then not only this phone but flagship phones will also heat up a bit and lag.

   I bought this in the sale and was very happy that I got in offer price, it worked very good the day we received but from next day we experienced wifi connectivity issue (wifi connects and disconnects by itself, I had done couple of phone resets but the issue didn't resolve & i raised the issue with Amazon customer service and they appointed mobile inspection service the next day. A person came and inspected but couldn't resolve and updated the issue as it is and same day received a call from the Amazon customer service and told they will replace with a new phone and received a replace but this time also we experienced the same issue, and now we are waiting for the person who will come for inspection to check the issue. It was the same and we asked for refund and refunded at last. Thank you Amazon. If this was the issue with Flipkart they would not refund and tell us to got to the service center. Amazon is the best👍

Average phone, don't expect much. Camera is just average.
","

  Average phone. Good for price. Camera sensor is very poor quality. If you take large 48 MP picture, you can see the dead pixels in the zoomed photo. They glitter like stars. Even if you cover the camera and take photo, these pixels come out white colours.Other than that, everything seems nice. I used a program to uninstall all the crap Xiaomi bloatware from my phone, (like mipay, cleaner, micommunity, etc).As a result I don't see any ads.I play asphalt 9, game runs smoothly in playable fps.Processor Helio G85 is same as G80, nothing extra.Mi UI is crap. My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins. Stock android is best.Final thoughts: Good phone to use for 1 year, 2 at most. Price could have been 1k less.Looking forward to buy pixel 4a next year when price comes down.

It's a great experience.
","

  I hope I wouldn't need to edit my comment if it's too early or after I am more experienced with the mobile , but using it for few days after purchasing it recently I would say that it's a beautiful phone with a brilliant display quality and size , faster performance and a more than satisfactory camera quality , not to mention of its huge 128 GB storage capacity. The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it. You will not even find many Google apps in the pre-installed app. Besides that you will be consuming your internet data faster with this phone , you know that.

Sensors problems
","

  I'm aware that when your colour mode is set to auto, the contrast can get really high in sunlight to make the display easier to see. I'm personally not a fan of this feature, so I turned it off on my previous phone.Now I've got the Redmi Note 9  with MIUI 11, but even after setting the colours to default, the contrast still changes in sunlight. What's worse, it tends to ""spas out"" when in a car for instance. It seems that the sensor/software is confused whether or not the contrast should be increased or not, so in the end the display starts to almost flash by continuously lowering and upping the contrast.I've tried restarting the phone, and turning the auto colour feature on and off. The problem still persists. Not sure if this is a bug or not. And if it's not a bug, is there a way to turn the feature off completely?

Redmi Note 9 Scarlet Red - Xiaomi at it's best again
","

  The look of the phone and color are awesome, for the first time I am using other than black and grey colors in phone.Camera - Selfie is amazing, back camera good but not up to the mark. But, if you select 48MP and took a photo, it is very good.Charging - Super fast, it took less than an hr from 20% - full charge.Weight - When you have case on it, you will feel something we are holding. Of-course every mobile will weigh, when you put the case on it.Performance - Since 2 days I am using it, it's really fast and want to observe more to write about it more.Display - it's large and very clear. Its an edge-to-edge screen and even we can change the settings of display to reduce the display size.Overall, if you are looking for best phone under 12K INR, blindly you can go for it.

Real me 6i or redmi note9?
","

  I am having both realme 6i and redmi note 9.I must say,always go for note 9.Realme 6i battery is really a shit.its draining more quickly when compared to note9.This is due to its 90hz display.Also there are heating issues while charging in realme  6i.Redmi note 9 is better in camera on good light conditions when compared to realme6i.Moreover realme  6i comes with 18 watt in box charger and redmi note 9 comes with 22.5 watt in box.even though real me 6i supports 30watt charging ,who's gonna buy that 30 watt charger that costs 1,400 rs.When coming into screen protection realme6i comes with an older version of gorilla glass whereas redmi note 9 comes with latest corning gorilla glass 5 (both camera and screen are protected).There are chances for real me 6i camera to get scratches as it is not protected using gorilla glass whereas note 9' s camera is protected with corning gorilla 5 glass.Final words: if you really worry about battery life then never ever go for realme 6i.A feature called 90 hz display in realme 6i drains it battery quickly.Its better to describe realme  6i as 'fast draining phone' rather than 'fast charging phone'.Guys don't believe in reviewers words as they say good review in favour of the mobile company which gives them better amount.Its better to ask your friends who brought this phone rather than watching review videos.

  Here's my review after using Redmi Note 9 for 3days.Perfect phone for a perfect price. Camera quality is just awesome.If I was to say about the battery, I would like to mention that it doesn't gives much backup. It drains faster. By 10:30pm that is before going to bed at night, I checked the buttery ℅ & it was 41%. When I checked it on morning by 5:30am after waking up, battery % was showing 32%.Without using the phone, 10℅ charge was gone within 7hrs. And also the super fast charging is useless. The phone takes 2.5hrs to charge from 0% to 100℅.Another weak point is that, it is MADE IN CHINA.☹️

Body sensor not working

  Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well.

  Oppo A31 4GB/64GB:It is Android 9. Phone updated software just after starting it for the first time. It has a software for cloning your old phone. Touch screen is good. Phone is faster and charging also faster. Camera is good in this price range. Phone size is big. It comes with transparent cover. You will need flip cover for more protection.

Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind

  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.

  Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.

  It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.

Don't look for Xiaomi with Helio chipset. Buy motorola E7 insted of this.

  Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience.

Redmi 9 disappointed me 😔😔.
","

  My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone.

Go for Redmi 8a Dual instead
","

  If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.

Decent overall package for an entry level phone
","

  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks

Don't buy this phone 😞📱
","

  Writing Review after 1 month use:Over all mobile is quite good in this price range but camera quality is very poor.I would suggest don't buy this phone, go with Redmi 9 Note.Poor camera quality.Bettery life is very good.MIUI 12 (Android 10) is very good. Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.Screen quality is good.Finger sensor is very quick.Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor. If your phone has really any defact then only it will get replaced with same model. You can't return & buy another better model.

Good phone for beginners
","

  I bought it for my mother, and she is learning to use it. 4GB/64GB at this price is really good. Touch is very responsive and quick. Screen quality is little dull and sound output is low compared to other Redmi phones. Redmi needs to work on these for budget phones. Camera is average as it is not camera centered phone. Network reception and battery power is good, last for 1.5 days with normal usage. Overall good phone for beginners and elderly people to start with

Redmi 9 review.
","

  Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.

  Display better for this price but if you can spend a 1000 rupees more go for Redmi 9 Prime which has better FHD display and good processor than this.

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

Go for any phone but not this if u don't want to regret wasting ur money

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

  Update 16 Oct 20Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op

Not recommended to buy Samsung M01 Core
","

  Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. Look of handset is sleek and smart but charer is Normal(Non-USB). To connect with other devices like laptop, PC, you will need to purchase extra USB cable. Backside of phone get heated if using for long time like an hour or more. I was recording video on 14.08.2020 and in 15-20 minutes, phone get overheated and I stopped video recording.

  Samsung didn't meet my expectations this time. I had been a big fan of Samsung products and this product of theirs disappointed me. Battery gets hot while watching videos, playing games and when connected to the net. Battery drains fast. Not suitable for video calls. Although I bought a 2GB RAM version, video and voice keeps cutting in and out. Tried different networks. No earphones. Cheap looking charger. Samsung should not compromise on quality. If they cannot afford to release a budget phone, they should not. Instead, continue with their mid and high range phones.

Not sure how many escalations i have to make replace the productThe product might be good but buying it from Amazon iz a pain.If you are unlucky and phone is dead you will keep begging for return.

  I do not understand why other reviews mention disappointment with performance. This is a BASIC BUDGET SMARTPHONE! Don't expect SD865 perf.Whom this phone caters to:1) Parents/Grandparents who have basic needs such as Whatsapp and YouTube2) People migrating from feature (button) phones3) Pre-teens' first phoneThe phone is preloaded with Google Go Apps, which are lighter versions of the regular apps.There is no bloatware, and the UI is optimised for the processor.Battery life is decent. Don't expect much. Charging is not fast at all. It takes around 2.5hr for 0-100. But again, this is not a complaint!Screen is 720p. Has a special 'Outdoor Brightness' mode for extra brightness.Speakers are decent. You can hear the ringtone!No face unlock/fingerprint scanner.I bought this phone for my grandmother who is migrating from a Samsung Guru button phone. It is perfect for her usage.Only complaint: This phone is missing a clock widget on the Home Screen!

  The mobile contains  poor battery quality. 80% of charge has been drained in 3 hours with average use. Do not buy it to waste your money.Amazon will mention to return or replace product within 7 days, at the time of purchase .But in actual they will delay unnecessarily and will pass the time frame , by different protocols, as nobody can return it .

  It's a 2GB phone, you can't expect much, even Facebook lags while going through lots of browsing. The camera is Ok. The build is not good, you must use a rubber cover and temper protection. It has a 3000mah battery that's why discharges quickly and doesn't support fast charging which creates more problems. Overall what you can expect at such a cost?Analyze your needs before purchasing it. The phone is decent for household usage with few apps, but if you want to have multiple apps then don't go for it..

  This review is solely for the seller who sold a faulty phone with a huge black spot on the screen. It is so obvious that proper quality check was not done before delivery. This can happen only in case of a used phond being sold as new.

  True Reviews,Worst phone in the world. Don’t see the YouTube reviews and buy this phone they are just lying. I wanted to give it less than one star but there was no option. I looks good in photos but is very very small phone. It lags and sticks a lot even in 2GB ram. A never buy product. Camera is freakin’ waste. They say it has 12MP camera but actually is like 2MP. The apps keep exiting themselves.And says app not responding. The WORST PHONE. Don’t buy this is my honest review. I bought it today and returned the phone on the same day it self within hours . If you wanna waste your money then invest in this phone . The packing and everything is rather soo good but phone does not function good at all.Thank You.

Just accept that they'll send one mobile service field agent to check whether the product is defective or not.. After they approved, they replace the old one and provide you a new one in that same product..In that replacement product also surely you'll face some defects so just ask for an refund directly through the options showing in that order page..

The knox security by Samsung in its A series smartphones is a boon to Indian customers, which can't afford ios based ecosystem considering its premium pricing. It's noway lesser efficient than ios. The quality of display in its entry level smartphones is also at par with the best of its class range smartphones. Pl improve the service and policy in the favor of customers. Rest is the best.

Definitely Best choice at the Price from SAMSUNG
","

  I used may types of android mobiles I purchased this mobile for my Mother and also to test how Android GO works.Things I Like in this device:-1. Camera - When I see the feature of 8MP Primary Camera, I thought that cameras may be average in this device.  But, in real the camera clarity was awesome at the price I real didn't expect this Samsung surprised  me. Even the Front 5MP camera also chapters clear pictures.  Rear Camera has dedicated flash and surprisingly Front Camera has Screen Flash(Good See this).***Camera samples - Cell Tower, Charger and Spectacles were captured with Samsung M01 Core. Other Pictures were captured by Some other devices.2. Display - Many companies who were selling the devices at 10k even above range are still providing HD+ (720P)  screen. But, I really felt happy that we are getting excellent display with good viewing angles at 5-6k.  But, we need to note that it is TFT display, not IPS display.3. Design - Samsung is providing mate texture finish at the back, Ofcourse it is made of cheap plastic it will  definitely protect the devices from scratches.4. Operating System - This device comes with Android GO which is the lite version of Android. But, it comes with  latest  Android 10 out of the box. And Android will provided updates regularly. I bought  2GB RAM variant and installed may apps(Not much larger apps, but some general purpose  apps) I didn't find any lagging issues while using them.5. Battery - This Device comes with 3000mah battery, but I noticed that Samsung mentioned that this was  typically, which means 3000mah was not the exact rating. But, still it's ok to have that capacity in this  device. As Android GO is the lighter version it almost consumes very less battery. You watch 4-5 hours  of YouTube videos with single charge. So definitely it is more at the price.Think I didn't like:-1. Very low charger rating - Out of the box it comes with 5V - 0.7A charger (3.5W) which is very slow to charger  3000mah battery. It takes 3+ hours to full charger the device. I have 10W fast charger  with me I tried to charger with that, I was charging up but still taking 3+ hours to  charge it. So, it won't accept fast charge. As a costumer we expect at least 10W  charger at the price.2. No Face Unlock - Face Unlock feature is very common in every device now. But, this feature was missing. They  are providing PIN, PATTERN and PASSWORD options to secure your device.3. Price - Actually, this is my bad luck. when I placed the order the price of the product is 6,499/- and I paid the  full amount online. It takes 2days to reach it to me, when I received the order the product price went  down to 5,999/-.

Further, the battery capacity, the RAM, and the latest Android version make the device value for money. Samsung always have brand value. I took this for my Dad who just moved from Nokia basic phone to this. He is happy using this.Recommended this phone as a secondary phone also.

Go for a good model rather than this and save your money.

  So, I had purchased this set on 8/sep with much excitement but i had never expected that i have to face soo much drama for replacement / refund.phone started heating after every 2minutes use, when you visit om replacement option,  where thr actually no any replacement option , thr is option to download the app or talk to techincan , you have to explain your problem twice- thrice to them...thn they will ask you to download the app..then they will check temperature then they will arrange a techincan visit at your place , after so much of struggle. Then you will will get replacement then again same problem (may persist or maynot be)  In my case i am not satisfied with product i thought it is of Samsung brand so i cn go for it but now there is no any exchange police😔😔 but (Kamchalu type model)!!  you can invest 2k more and can go for a good model...2star...ps- such a long review but it is truthhhhhhh, now i will think twice before purchasing from amazon!!

Phone Software Hangs
","

  I bought this no-frills product for my mother for her basic phone use.In just a month it started to hang. The phone sometimes just freezes during calls, does not respond to touch, button press or long wait. I consider it a blot on brand Samsung - when they can not build a problem free basic phone then what can be expected from expensive phones?Also, I am not very impressive with the build quality, it is so light that it makes me feel everything inside is just cheap plastic. Don't know how long it will last.

Will have to wait and see if this develops into an issue.Battery life could have been better. Drains power without any background App. Max 1 day. Samsung Max inbuilt software could aid elongate battery, but difficult to use Apps when you need. So I put App asideSamsung advantages of ease of setting up etc is good.

  Pathetic. Hanges so long not ever seen in any phone. Siper slow. Camera worst,even old nokia 0.3 MP is so much better than this. Dont dont buy. Worth only 1000 to 1500 Rs. Dont think it is made by samsung, a market cheep crap item. Amazon not returning this as quality is not a parameter to return. I have used samsung j2, j3 etc of this price range that was 100 times better than this. We have to start a movement to boycott this type of strategy of amazon and samsung to sell their third class crap in the name of there reputed brand and dont take return. Dont dont dont buy this. You will surely regret.

  Excelent phone for my father in law. I have bought this phone for my father in law as he needs phone which should be small and handy and very lightweight in hand and Major issue with this phone is slow charging and quick battery draining. and one more thing I don’t like in this phone that is when u continues use it for 25-30 minutes it start getting heat which is not good.

","

  Very nice phone for the price from a proven brand unlike the chinese phones. All good about the phone. Only con is that it is a tad bit slow in general. If Samsung can improve the speed a little bit cheap this would be the best phone to buy at this price range. And this would then simply beat all those cheap chinese phones. Great effort by Samsung but needs a little improvement. Still would recommend this phone for those seeking a value buy from a good brand.

Battery Blunder
","

  Note : for those whose mobile got switched off , press power and volume button at same time . It will be on in safe mode. Then you may restart or can work as it is . ...I purchased for my mother. Because it is small and lightweighted i thought it is perfect for my mom. Previously she had Redmi 7A but because i dont want to have any chinese phone in my home , i decided to exchange with this.Pros : So cute , so small , light weighted , less price , good speed ....cons: Battery , Battery , Battery... My 3 year old J7 2016 (3300Mah )(large screen than this) gave 1 and half day backup and this phone not give backup of single day . MY mother just use 3 to 4 hr daily . Then also My Mom got frustated . She even asked me to give her old phone back. Amazon was not returning this. I gave threat to go to consumer forum and after 2nd visit of technician they understood my problem and gave my money. I really go to consumer court if Amazon wouldnt have accepted my return . Its not about amount but the pain of feeling cheated daily which cause anger. After that i ordered for M21 and contrary to my expectation my mom was happy with large screen . M21 is Awesome . The Best thing about samsung phone is their UI . I love it . So if u r budget conscious then may consider other option but dont go for samsung in less than 10k phone. But I feel that samsung will improve its battery . But i request everyone to not buy chinese product.

Good phone under the 10k bracket for people who want a Made-in-India phone.
","

  My review is based on almost 3 weeks of continuous useage.Battery life - The battery life is very good and easily lasts more than a day. However, charging with the in-box charger is very slow.Camera - The camera isn't bad but it isn't something to boast about. It does fairly well in bright sunlight conditions and not so well in dark conditions wherein the pictures are blurry and full of grains.Screen - The screen is pleasantly bright and legible. Good colour balance and vibrance. However, the touch, at times, feels laggy. Rarely even bordering on non-functional.Performance - Performance is as is expected from a phone in this price range, not very good but not shabby either. It gets basic jobs done and struggles with apps that require more resources.

Its got  a  2GB RAM with a Internal memory of 32GB, its got a front and back camera, its got a screen size that is big enough, and fits comfortably in your hand. Best of all its price  is absolutely reasonable  for a phone with 32GB and expandable  upto a little ove 500GB in steps.The only item that I cannot comment on is that it has a  built in battery of 3000 Mah. how long will it last only time will tell, but overall the whole package comes with a 6 month warranty.

Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..

  The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement.

Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21.

The best phone money can buy at this price
","

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀

Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too.

Super Slow Camera, Big Battery & Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna
","

  I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k

Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.

Yeah...it's best in this budget...
","

  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.

Samsung phones have signal strength issues
","

  I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc

Nice phone with a bad processor

  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved

Honest Review of Samsung galaxy m21.
","

  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till now🤞🤞🤞10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.👍👍👍

Issues with wi-fi calling, battery, fingerprint sensor etc.

  Everyone is removing Chinese products from their life and hence I also planned to throw Xiaomi from my gadget and start using Samsung from now onwards. I further thought to convince my friends & relatives to use Samsung gadgets instead of Xiaomi. But after purchasing Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon which was delivered on 30-05-2020, my whole enthusiasm went in trash and I am helpless to compare it with my last handset Redmi 8 which was valued just Rs. 7,999/- as compared to Rs. 12,699/- of Samsung Galaxy M21. I don’t want to compare Samsung with Xiaomi handsets, but now realize how Xiaomi has captured Indian market in short span of time, surely because of quality & performance of their gadgets.I am trying Amazon customer care since 01-06-2020, but unable to connect and no response from their side. Below are serious issues found in just 2-3 days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 :• While using wi-fi calling feature, outgoing calls & receiving of SMS gets completely barred• While using wi-fi, HD call gets stopped• Whole battery gets drain in just 6-7 hours, not upto 6000 mAh handset performance.• Fingerprint sensor is very weak, it takes 3-4 times for login• Dual apps feature is limited for few applications only• Voice recording feature needs improvementPlease support in getting this issue resolved at the earliest.

Second review
","

  This is my second review.  This is after a week's use. So far I have found that phone is good. In my first review I had tod that battery is not that good. But now I feel that I was wrong. A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain. (Only finish).One of the main problem I face is the search button for contacts. It is placed in a corner and that too very small. And if I search a contact. After few days if I open contacts again, what I searched will still remain there. I have to go all the way back to search again.

  The best to choose among the available choices in this range.  I am using it since one week and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.  Only difficulties I faced was to find app lock and split screen. But these purposes were fulfilled by external apps from the play store.I strongly recommend purchasing this phone. The best value for money product. I am full satisfied with the purchase 😊

Amazing, definitely!
","

  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!

Too Early to Rate but had a bitter experience on the Product, already!
","

  Guess it was a problem with the seller, and not the product. The seller just delivered a used product with loads of defects. The camera was not functioning, the torch was not functioning and there could be more defects. I was just checking the item the moment it was delivered and encountered with these two defects. Upon unboxing, I found that the phone had a tempered glass already fitted to it. Initially I overlooked this but later realized that someone who had purchased it invested on the glass (and may have used it for a couple of days) with the defects before finally rejecting it. I think the M21 product should be fine and it is upon the seller who tried to strike a deal in such troubled times. So beware of the seller!

Excellent call quality and network reception
","


  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.

  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it's a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can't tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it's own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn't have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it's that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it's fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it's the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen's and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM's software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it's nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10's stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI's.battery:- it's a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason ""because Samsung thinks we are a fool"" it's a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don't know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it's camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it's a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it's a plastic phone and have plastic's quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it's a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it's fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don't select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don't play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!

AWESOME PHONE FOR THE PRICE, BUT NOT FOR PUBG LOVERS
","

  No doubt i am loving Samsung m 21 4/64, which i ordered on 25th may, got delivered on 27th may. One thing to consider, this smartphone excels in display, camera quality and battery life...Processor is not that  powerful or not even close to sd 675 in terms of gaming. I have to use gfx tool, lowering resolution( less than hd) and other graphics stuff to Low with fps set to ultra(40fps). By applying this gfx tools settings i can play Pubg hell lot better with stable 30-40 fps. Dont try extreme,fps will be very unstable. With stock Pubg settings i am facing tremendous lags, stutters and fps drops even in the lobby, Cant say about 6/128 gb model. Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only. My verdict if u are not too much into gaming, Play clash of clans, or can adjust to above settings of Pubg, Go ahead to buy,  If pubg is top priority go with Vivo U20/Realme 6/Redmi note 9.

Wise Choice of an ""All Rounder"" Smartphone - Heartful review - Vera Level Phone
","

  No wonder why Samsung is the most used & most loved smartphone brand in the world! This is my first Samsung phone and I exchanged my previous damaged phone online for 2k.After spending one whole month in researching the best phone under 15k, I finally got it figured out and chose Galaxy M21. And Youtube videos and comments helped me take the wise choice. I got the deal (4gb 64gb) at Rs.13,500 and got it delivered in 6 days.Plenty of reasons why I chose M21:Will to honour our country heroesMonster BatteryGreat Display (feels like you are also present in the movie)Trust in Samsung Brand NameBetter CameraLesser weight (a boon for long time gamers)Polycarbonate back (safe against drops)Premium look rather than Fancy Nancy cheap plastic bodyType C ChargerThe Processor Debate:To those who wonder the same as I did (If we can play Pubg smoothly),The honest answer is YES. Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can't say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too. So i easily charge every night before going to sleep and turn it off in middle of night.Super Tips for Common Problems in All PhonesUpdate OS to avoid heating & restart issue (which happens not only in M21 but even in 60k phonesNever use a phone cleaner or battery saver app. Use the inbuilt power saving option.Turn off Bluetooth, Location, etc when not neededDon't charge even after reaching 100%Close apps when not needed, especially close all when playing game (and also enable gaming mode)Uninstall least used appsWhoever reads this comment can trust me and click the Amazon ""Buy Now"" button without any fear because this is the ONE perfect-ish smartphone under 15k category.Friends.... this phone feels like you hold jewel in your hand .

BEST MID RANGE SMARTPHONE ON THE PLANET EARTH
","

  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn’t try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that’s just fine. Let me be clear: I don’t have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn’t feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone’s battery lasts for so long, you don’t want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone’s battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn’t annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don’t try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won’t get a great camera system, and that’s one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That’s not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn’t too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21’s 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that’s not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there’s a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.

Good camera, better battery life, best display & doesn't lag

  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   CAMERAThe camera setup takes fine pictures in both natural and artificial lighting conditions. The 48MP sensor does take sharper images but lacks advanced HDR although in 16MP mode HDR works great. On zooming it doesnot take decent shots, just oversharpen the images and bumping the contrast. The wide angle 128° is awesome with wide dynamic range the pics are excellent although this lens struggles in moderate to low light scenarios.This phone takes decent videos all the way upto UHD 4K. The video stabilization is phenomenal. Although when using super steady mode you can't use wideangle or zoom lens and also it crops in a bit but overall a solid camera. The 20MP front camera takes average selfie but great videos. Also night mode is a fraud. Night mode doesn't work.DISPLAYThe super amoled display alone is the reason why I'll recommend this phone to everyone. It's stunning, colour accurate, sharp & crisp, and also emit less blue light so gentle on eye too.SOFTWAREAndroid 10.0 operating system with one UI 2.0 is fast & fluid and it stays like that. It doesn't lag now and it doesn't lag in future. The one UI skin is extreamly functional and fluid. IT DOESN'T LAG. It comes with loads of pre-installed apps but 90% of them can be manually uninstalled or disabled so no big deal. Timely monthly updates and one major OS update. KNOX is not there in this phone but thats fine in general samsung software is one of the secure software in android realm.PERFORMANCEThe exynos processor is somewhat comparable to snapdragon 660 and handles games and everyday tasks with breeze. Although sometimes framerates fluctuates in heavy games like call of duty and similar games. But for 95% of the times this processor will excel at whatever you throw at it.BATTERYThe battery life is great. I'm having about 8-9 hrs screen on time with auto brightness on and mobile data on all the time with moderate usage and some games & navigation along the way. 15w fast charging takes about 2.5-3 hrs to charge it up.MISCELLANEOUSThe fingerprint reader works fast & fine. Bottom speaker is not too loud but sound doesn't crack in high volume. The earpiece is adequately clear and audible. The build quality is excellent too having no flex. The USB-C port is nice upgrade. With 0.468W/Kg SAR Value it's very safe phone radiation wise.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage.

  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍

My Real Review - M31 is Average
","

  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.

  I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed!I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung!I so miss my POCOFirst the pros1. The brand name - if you think it is one!2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos4. Build - seems decentCons:1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates meAnyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me nowWhat a waste of Money this has been

  Cons:1. RAM. Claims to be 6GB, whereas my 2year old phone with 4GB RAM has much smoother display2. Battery Charging. Claims 15W fast charging. Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone.Pros:1. Good cameras2. Perfect screen sizeI bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment. And they say it cannot be returned. Total waste of money for me. Redmi Note pro 8 is much better than this at same price.

not up to mark, waste of money

  1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around.2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point.3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone.bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.

Review after a week of usage
","

  I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and consPros:1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also.2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex

  Very poor performance.. camera is ok not bad . But very slow net speed .. opening app time is relatively fast but after internet is very slow .... my old mobile Samsung on max is much faster performance for loading web page than Samsung m31 .. this phone taking much more time to open any web site ... remaining everything is ok ..Fast changing is not far like they said .. 30 mins charging it charging 20% but my old Samsung is 30% charged at same time . I have found this two major drawback.

HONEST REVIEW BY USER
","

  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)

Best Budget phone for Avg Users

  It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery.Pros :1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.

  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually

Ok product for the price range
","

  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.

BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.
","

  I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this.Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.

Great 📱🔥❤️

  Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.

Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it

  Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution.After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot.Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜). Think before buying this phone.Edit: After 9 months of usage: I am not facing the heating issues now. I had the heating problem while using hotspot for entire day. Battery backup is also good now. But facing some issues in camera. After the latest software update, the photos are some times showing our face like a black and white. This issue is happening only few times and the issue is on only around face. Complained to samsung but no action taken. They are asking for more logs from my phone. Other than this, phone is good to use.

For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR

  hi,I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm.On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good.Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall.However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting. Seems like it needs high lighting

As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.

Great buy. Excellent camera and battery for this price.

  I was really excited for this phone. Ordered on the 5th of march and got it on the 6th. So far loved it and here's my review.My first impression was the weight being so good for a 6000mah battery phone. Also the display is excellent and every movie buff will love this. It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.

  (After 2 months usage)The only advantage is AMOLED display.Performance of this phone is not at par.Battery is also disappointing as far as 6000 MAH is given, it only last a whole day.I was using 3500 mah phone earlier and that almost lasted same. Than 6000 mah should last too much longer than that, it's not optimised.Phone also gets heated sometimes even in normal usage (no games)Also build of the quality is not as standard for this range. It looks ok but actually cheap. The plastics make sounds when you feel it by fingers.Many scratches at back after 2 months usage.Material is just not very good.I did not find it fast enough for 6 GB RAM.Processor is slow. CALL DIALING, and normal features also run slow on this phone.Camera is also not very good.To sum it up, camera, battery ,performance is not up to standards and disappointing and only good id amoled display.

Best in class, but with a few exceptions
","

  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?

DONT PURCHASE this M31.

  Apart from battrey and screen nothing is good. Front facing camera as per specs is of 32mp. But when u go for high resolution it show 21MP... TOTALLY CRAP. My samsung j7's 8mp is FAR MORE BETTER THAN this one in terms of front camera. FRAUD BY SAMSUNG.Finger prnt reader is not able to detect most of the times.

BAAP of Power and features
","

  I bought this phone as soon as it was launched, a month ago after my Galaxy S10 was stolen. I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.

Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.
","

  A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.

Battery consumption
","

  1) From 0 to 100% taking more than 2 hours.2) Battery consuption is high due to default SAMSUNG apps which cannot be deleted and also reducing performance.3) Not possible to Delete NETFLIX4) Even if you download any app from Samsung store you have to upgrade it through Google Play Store, better to directly download latest updated version from Google Play Store directly5) Available RAM for use is only 3.2 GB due to too many unnecessary SAMSUNG APPS are not allowed to uninstall.It was my first and last mobile of NON STOCK ANDROID mobile, earlier used 5 stock android mobiles out of 6 gb RAM it provided 4.8 GB availablity and all non required apps can be deleted so purchasiñg ""Stock android"" mobile is only good option if want to purchase Android mobileDear Samsung - It was not your fault, I wasnt aware that purchasing NON Stock android will have additional mandatory apps of your company, Can you push OTA update for my device and make it stock android?

  I saved money for 5 months and bought this phone about 25 days ago. First thing is you cant replace it after these days and now it is getting restarted in-between  i am working on it. Not just that , it does not turn on but only the samsung logo shows for 1-2 hours. Now you cant do anything. I went to service center . They kept this phone for 3 days and did nothing . They said to me to pick up my phone after all the data has been deleted and phone's has been reset . And the very next day , here I am with this same problem . I am regretting a lot with samsung . And cant just go to service center daily. Its 50 km far from my residence.

Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online
","

  Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products

An underappreciated budget phone
","

  There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.

Dont be hurry in buying for Samsung M31
","

  I bought Samsung M31 (6gb,128gb model) 20 days back. First time my hate for samsung reached to peaks.  I made this purchase by keeping following factors :1. Brand - Samsung2.  Released in March 2020  (Felt latest model)3.  Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable. Do research and take reviews from the people who are using the phone then go for a better option.I will write above cons to samsung. Please dont waste your money. 10 days replacement only - If someone bought already do thorough checks and replace the phone.

Samsung make fool to their customers in the name of warranty

  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....

Disappointing 64MP Camera!!!!
","

  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.

  Do not buy this phone.Its display quality is very bad. My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?

This is an average phone just with battery backup only  and not great w r to speed and performance
","

  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.

  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!

Phone is very laggy and apps crashes.2. Touch screen works slow. Even while receiving calls, if u swipe up to answer, it won't respond.3. Thanks to cheap quality earphones.4.

  The phone is an alternative to chinese companies flooding the market. Display is very dull, fingerprint sensor at times doesnt work, but not a deal breaker, can live with it. Low quality screen guard already stuck when delivered makes the display worse. There was an extra screen guard, wondering if I got a returned product, box seemed sealed and all though.Apart from that, its a good VFM (< ₹7000) phone with a lot of features some of its competitors dont have. Its a functional smartphone without the unnecessary apps (data stealing ones) which comes loaded with other phones. Battery backup is good. Overall good for a senior citizen or users who dont waste their lives staring at cellphone screens and use it for communicating and a bit of internet usage.

Substandard phone.
","

  Had purchased an older model of Panasonic Eluga a couple of years ago for a family member. Still working well. Based on that experience I purchased this newer model i7, but it was such a big disappointment. Phone was excruciatingly slow, photos were grainy and many more issues. Didn't expect such low quality from a well known brand. Fortunately I was able to return it.

  Phone has a awesome look and very handy best for senior citizen. Ok i write this review after 1 days as they are lying at so many things1.st the phone doesn't even support 32 gb of memory card and they have written 256 gb expandable2. And it can support a 2 or 4 gb memory card but if u use them u can only keep them in 1st sim as the 2nd sim is nano sim and u can't be able to use jio sim if we use memory cardSo there u will have only one thing to choose 4g or a memory cardSo very disappointingU should not lie to customerOverall the device is good just it don't support memory is bad :-(:-(

Panasonic egula i7

  I gifted this phone for my mom. This phone is suitable for senior people, if u r looking for gaming or multi-tasking, it's no use.What I liked:1. It's a complete package, you get charger, backcase, screen protector and earphones.2. Android 9 with decent battery backup.3. I got it for ₹6180 so worth money.I disliked:1. Phone is very laggy and apps crashes.2. Touch screen works slow. Even while receiving calls, if u swipe up to answer, it won't respond.3. Thanks to cheap quality earphones.4. Overall I'm really frustrated by this phone, never gonna buy any panasonic brand from now.

Good phone for senior citizens
","

  The phone is an alternative to chinese companies flooding the market. Display is very dull, fingerprint sensor at times doesnt work, but not a deal breaker, can live with it. Low quality screen guard already stuck when delivered makes the display worse. There was an extra screen guard, wondering if I got a returned product, box seemed sealed and all though.Apart from that, its a good VFM (< ₹7000) phone with a lot of features some of its competitors dont have. Its a functional smartphone without the unnecessary apps (data stealing ones) which comes loaded with other phones. Battery backup is good. Overall good for a senior citizen or users who dont waste their lives staring at cellphone screens and use it for communicating and a bit of internet usage.

  First of all this is the best value for money . For 5000rs I got decent smartphone, good headphones, cover, screen guard. The phone is having reasonably fast response (maybe not the best in class but decent).  I have installed about 20 apps like whatsapp, gpay, paytm, adobe reader, facebook, gaana etc and I didnot face any hanging issues, no battry heatings even after prolonged use. The battery itself last for 2 days of intense use. Cant ask more for the money. It maynot handle games but for the rest you cannot beat this. All the criticism here is from the chinese chamchas. Made in india for me always over some cheap chinese crap.

Good in the price range. But don't expect high performance
","

  It is the enterprise version I bought on 14 aug ,2020 for my father. After using the phone I think the phone is bit slower. This phone is not recommended for young generation. The click response time is bit slow. When I was first time setting up the phone and it was updating all the apps and the system update was running at the same time, the phone was very slow. But after all updation done it is working fine . If you want to buy it for parent or any old person with basic smartphone feature then go for it. This is a better phone than other phone brands available in this price range.

  This is the worst possible phone. First of all it is not Eluga I7 it is Eluga I7 ENTERPISE EDITION and that makes all the trouble. Since it is the so called Enterprise Edition you don't get and accessories which fits this useless phone. Neither a good screen guard nor a proper flip cover. Lot of issues cloning data from another phone. In all a horrible experience with this phone. This is even before I actually start using the phone.

  Camera is very worst, In indoor lighting pictures are getting blurred, Front camera is something like 4 years back quality because it has only 8MP.When coming to back camera even with 48MP, photos are not clear.My suggestion is not to purchase this mobile, if you can bare 1000/- more, best choice is Redmi note9 or you can purchase realme phones with in this budget.I tried to return the product due to camera quality not expected, but return will not take return back due to quality issue for mobile phone.I purchased many Mobiles, but this is my first worst experience.So please don't by this mobile 🙏🙏🙏🙏

And touch is also responding slow.5) Games: I didn't try much yet.6) Weight: BulkyI bought it because of the camera but a little bit disappointed with it.

Roughly after one month use
","

  After a month use....Phone is just ordinary.  No effects of the memory options are noticed.  In fact it takes roughly 2 minutes to get to the main screen after power on.  Preloaded with 13-15 gb of system files and bloatware.  So you get to use only 49 GB effective storage place.The phone is like paying for our dish TV, you will be forced to watch a lot of advertising apps.A lot of personal information may be used, your mi id will be linked to phone, email, ip address, location etc.Earlier I used Lenovo p2 nothing of this, and was a great phone.Having said all bad things, the phone is good for sound, visual, and battery.  Camera is the worst part.If you are buying for a camera then this one is a bad choice.  Battery 🔋 and the sound is great.Too many bloatware, I suppose Redmi should pay attention.  Or we all should avoid the phone and the brand.Repair would be easy as Redmi has many service centers around the country.  Except battery and music I don't see any difference or advantage over other phones for routine activities.Overall very average phone 📱 which is priced on higher side.

Cons are so frustrating that amazon have now blocked giving direct reviews of this phone it seems. only genuine buyers can review it.pros:dual speaker, HD clarity on netflix n amazon primecons:1.camera takes literally 7secs to open (before installing extra apps on mobile itself),2.if u open netflix etc forget that it opens any other app without 10secs lag. so horrible i have never seen.3.third point is camera quality.. please don't buy seeing details on paper for this phone.4.memory management is so horrible that any app u open n switch to other app even for 3secs,it'll close old app i mean MIUI will literally kill ur apps so that you have to wait for double lag on ur screen.Last mobile I bought from xaiomi. it broke the real fans with this mobile basically.6.lastly, it doesn't have notification light which exists in 4year old phones from redmi series.verdict is.. just don't get into trap seeing details and numbers of this phone. it can't even handle basic functionalities without lag. maybe MIUI 12 is too bulky on this worthless piece.

Overall a budget phone with lots of bloatware
","

  Using this phone since a month and some of the key features are missing and facing other issues with MIUI12.Pros:  1)Good battery backup, but charging from 95% to 100% will take longer in the end.  2)Non-slippery and sturdy build quality  3)Comes with pre-applied screen guard which is still working fine.  4)Good sound qualityCons:  1)There is no Notification light, when you are charging there is no indication that it is even charging or fully charged.2) There is no notification light for any alerts which you receive, when you keep the phone for charging or when you receive any sms, missed calls, etc. You will have to unlock the phone and check the notifications.3) The camera quality is OK. You will have to learn how to use quad cameras properly via youtube videos.4) When you enable FingerPrint, Password lock, then Google backup stops working. This is major issue in this phone.5) The local MIUI backup for call history, sms history  doesn't work at all and it fails continuously. I showed it to the MI retailer shop and also to the customer care, even after 2 factory resets, this feature doesn't work. The only way to backup call history, sms history is via Google backup. But for google backup to work you have to disable Fingerprint lock. So, overall a bad backup experience in the current MIUI 12.0.6.06) Comes with lots of un-removable MIUI bloatware. I removed them manually via XDA tool on PC, apps like MiPay, MiCloud, Wellbeing, Mi Credit, Facebook, etc. A non-technical user or elders will have to live with all the bloatware of MIUI which shares your personal data with external applications by default. Better to watch some tips and tricks online and disable them.

Usless apps promotion and keep hanging
","

  Worst than Nokia and Microsoft mobile. I am from sales background and pure need of mobile for calling and switching multiple apps. I have been using Samsung J7 Prime from 5 years and still that is going good. But today's generation boys make me feel my mobile is old and internet speed isn't great because of old device and neeneed to look for new mobile. And I asked to go for this redmi. I was 90% sure I will go with Samsung again but they made me to belive Redmi is better than Samsung.Now the story begin. It's absolutely scrap. Redmi might compete with anyone but they aren't great. My internet speed remain same as I use to have on years old Samsung. Samsung nevers hangs in 5 years, but this mobile hangs frequently. I m irked customer of Nokia which troubled me after 1 year use  but this mobile irk just after 20 days.Photo quality I beluve J7 5 year old mobile camera us equally good than this 48 mp camera.Connecting headphone is headache. I have 2-3 google meet a day, now I always connnect with Laptop as this mobile burn my fingure to connect hard or to stress hard to keep connecting headphones.The day received I have trouble but Amazon denied to replace or return back saying this mobile is perfectly ok just by installing a app on your mobile and fool you to belive mobile is ok. After hard argument they suggest to contact Redmi service center. On the name of Replacement it's trap. But it at your risk.Don't get trab of young generation promoting redmi to buy because only if camera. Choice is yours, you buy it's for calls or camera.Lastly this mobile keep on promoting to download all useless app like play rummi, moz, chat share many many more. It's already have plenty of useless and harmfull preloaded apps. I dosent understand is this Redmi owned by single management. Everday same usless apps are recommend to download again and again. It's junk box. Good buys to redmi forever and byby to Amazo  for never I will buy mobile on Amazon.

  It seems like purchased a used mobile phone, looks wise its good but when it comes to camera then I gave 2 out of 10, the front camera is like useless, it remembers you a VGA type camera quality.

Not for power users
","

  It's a good phone with horrible software. Here are some fixes.1. Ads - use Blockada to block all MIUI ads and trackers. This is free and does NOT require root. As a personal preference I also use the Nova Launcher to make the phone's UI look more polished and close to stock Android.2. Phone recording - This is an absolutely stupid inconvenience that Xiaomi shoved into their phones which nobody asked for. This phone uses Goggle Dialer meaning you can NOT discreetly record all your calls and the phone will play an alert saying This call is being recorded'. In my opinion, this is the worst thing about this phone because it is unfixable without rooting it. Every other xiaomi phone lets you use the miui dialer with the built-in discreet automatic call recorder. NOT THIS ONE. I hate this and hope xiaomi fixes this with a software update.3. Camera quality: It's not bad, it's actually pretty good for the price. But you can get way better photos by using the G-Cam APK. Google 'Gcam for Redmi 9 Power'. At the time of writing, the gcam port does not support video.Other annoying things that can't be fixed via software:1. Lack of LED light2. Imbalanced speakers. The bottom speaker is way more powerful than the top, this makes the stereo effect super annoying, even though a lot of paid YouTubers would have touted it as a feature. It gets annoying unless you're holing it in a way that amplifies the top speaker. This can be mitigated a little by messing with the equalizer, but that sounds like too much work unless you're willing to mess with it every time you plug in your headphones.3. My screen protector came pre-applied, but it was off-center. My eyes have gotten used to it, but that was a horrible first impression.4. It's made by a Chinese company.Positives:1. Nice bang-for the buck.2. Great in-hand feel3. Long-lasting battery4. Has IR blaster which is handy sometimesNeutrals1. The Redmi logo is big, but it's hardly visible. I can only see it under a specific light. Otherwise it's fine. I'd prefer if they were more classy about it along with being subtle.I can't recommend this phone to most people because of the voice recording / google dailer mess. Otherwise this would have been a good phone. I don't regret buying it, but it doesn't make me happy that i bought it.

  Overall I'm not satisfied with the product. Even if it have a good processor but the day to task is very laggy. I can't run some simple games like Candy Crush without lag. It hangs a lot. I have purchased the mobile for my mother but it's a disaster.Camera is also average even if it has a 48mp camera. Photo output is soft.

  You will always feel bulky. I find below cons1. Too bulky, specially I feel bulky because I moved from Iphone 6 to this phone. Please check weight and dimension if it suits.2. It has a protective film on-screen which is useless. U soon need a screen protector when u buy.3. Bluetooth is the worst. I keep on reconnecting with my Garmin watch. However, it was no that condition with my iPhone.4. Battery life is good. It is a type C charge but takes time to full charge. More than 2 hrs.5. The box has a transparent back cover.6. Photography is average. My iPhone 6 with 8 MP was similar of this 48 MP camera.

Good Product with Reasonable Features
","

  Bought this device to my mom and used this device for a week before writing this review.Personally I found this device is good.Hardware:--I found that the camera quality is not up to the mark, can't expect more in this price range.--Fast charging working good and takes around 1hr and 40 mins to charge from 0 to 100--Fingerprint sensor there is a small delay when compared to other mobile phones at this price range.--Battery is really good, though there are a few reviews mentioning that the battery isn't good, I didn't face much issues with it. It easy survived for more than 40 hours after using some basic apps like WhatsApp, YouTube, Prime Video and Spotify.Software:--The UI seems good, except some apps which keeps crashing every time. (Requires a software update to avoid that)--Experienced no Lag when switching between apps or while using apps.Over all this is a good device at this price range. Definitely not recommended if you use many apps and install heavy games, as many apps crash while using. Can gift it to parents who doesn't use many apps or can be used as a secondary mobile phone.

Best in this price range.  Go for it
","

  I am writing this review after a month.Just loved the phone man. I just can't believe that I got this phone at such a great price. 48 MP Quad cam setup is extremely powerful to get those crystal clear photos with sharp quality. 6000 mAh battery literally stays for 1-2 days even after extreme usage and 2-3 if we use only for calling and WhatsApp and with the 18W charger in the box is amazing as it just takes much less time compared to its battery lifespan. The speakers are much louder and sound like a home theater. The processor is awesome for gaming on medium graphics and good for high graphics for sometime. The gorilla glass is literally hard like a gorilla because I just mistakely dropped my phone 1-2 times from a human height without case and screen guard then too not a single scratch appeared. This display and screen is also too good.Conclusion -: If you want to buy a awesome phone with a decent and good gaming processor in budget then must go for it.

  I was looking for a phone to be gifted to my mom... But below 10k the configurations and brands weren't enough pleasing but then when I found Vivo it was just so perfect.The color of the back side of mobile is so elegant,the camera quality is also very good, clear and battery life is great.

Read this review and think whether to buy or not
","

  This is a review as a moderate user.1. Agate red is stylish......2. Battery life stands three days with moderate gaming of aproximate 1 hr per day (free fire) on low power mode.3. Camera is ok for this price range.4. Dispay is good.5. Gaming performace is good when playing freefire in smooth and standard settings.6. There are lots of feature in this phone like low power mode, ultra power saving mode, game mode, one hand mode, etc... Check YouTube videos for the features.7. Finger print reader and face recognition is fast. I prefer finger print and turn off face recognition for saving battery life.8. The best thing is, I bought this phone using amazon paylater for zero emi for three months.

  Superb battery backup, till now no hanging issue noticed. Very good mobile for the basic users. Camera quality is average and u can see noise in the picture taken. Finger print sensor & facial recognition works well even with mask on. No issues with the mobile network & 4G data connectivity, data reception is very good. But WIFI part works slow with 75 to 90 mbps line showing on other handsets & laptop, this mobile will show only 10 to 11 mbps max.Overall good mobile for basic user.

  I bought it for my mother, she uses to make video calls and surfing YouTube. Ideal for basic use. The pricing could be 1k less for this kind of configuration.

  The phone was for my wife who broke her previous Android phone.Pros-Nice screen, good resolution and brightnessBattery last about a day and a halfConsLot of bloatwareThe default screen background is pale grey and the phone's text shows up in a darker grey. Looks classy but difficult to read esp. outdoors.They have crammed in too many functions so the system seems complicated to use and some functions/features which were on the Motorola with an older version of Android, or my OnePlus 5T appear not to be available..... or we have not been able to discover it inspite of trying!The hardware is good for the price. Ease of use is the problem. Would not have purchased if we knew.

Fair deal by brand samsung

  I am writing the review after use of about 1 day. I purchased it for my mother. She is very happy to have it. Aa she was earlier user of Samsung basic mobile and she used the mobile for about 6 years. So now she upgraded to smartphone of this brand because in her opinion Samsung mobiles are long lasting. In my opinion:-  Display- 4.5/5  Battery- 5/5  Camera- 5/5  Performance- 4/5  Look- 4/5  Value for money- 4.5/5Display is good and bright as usual Samsung display are always of better quality.  Sound is not best but okay. Look is good but need improvement in back design as it seems to be a cheap plastic material. Battery has no complaints. Camera specially front camera is surprisingly good. But performance should be improved as somtime touch is less responsive.so if you are multitasker and heavy user of mobile then itz not for you. but keeping the price in mind 7299 rs for 3gb ram and 32 gb storage its a fair deal as you are attached to Samsung brand which is better than cheap chinese mobiles like Mi, Oppo, etcPlz don't forget to like if fou find my review helpful 👍

  So I recieved the phone a few days back. And I will be using this phone as my primary phone. So I will keep this brief and almost to the point.Build quality- tacky looking, good, but can be improved for future budget phones. I got grey color, and it's not metallic, my mum says the rear looks like shahbadi floor tiles. Not an insult. Anyways I like it, but it's not metallic.Screen- personally, I am happy with it, touch feedback is nice too, but ofcourse not like 20k+ range phones.touch is very responsive in the calculator app.Battery- well 5000mah, good, it's quite more than necessary for me but good.Camera- macro camera- took a fair enough macro shot, 2mp. 3.2mp would have been a sweet spot in budget yet good quality. Front and main camera yet to test fully. Night time photos? Forget it. Honestly even most mid range phones don't fare well in night.Processor power- its not a powerful chip to begin with, but fine, I am going to manage with it. For others, the phone is a bit laggy/slow in some aspects..or most. Camera takes a good whole second or 2 to start, the viewfinder flow is not smooth and laggy/glitchy.but I like the wide and macro combination. SHOULD'VE BEEN 3.2MP :'(More apps= bit more lag while entering main menu. So the less no of apps, should suffice. I opened a bunch of apps, including 3 Google tabs in browser, and many apps, lag was not severe slowdown, but was a little slower than before or it's slow to begin with and didn't really have high expectations. Using the device care and/or restarting the phone did feel better and smoother, but took a good whole 7 to 10 seconds for the live wallpaper to load. Talking of wallpapers, even being samsing OneUI, there is no option for galaxy themes :(I am not gonna do any major gaming on this so I cannot say anything on it's regard, I prefer pc gaming. But don't expect much, however if you really want have a  experience where you'd feel better/happy with the purchase, I'd suggest playing classic games like Mario, crash bandicoot etc. Some game suggestions- Dadish, alto.I will update this review after a week/months use. And finally a half/full year update.If you have a budget of atleast 10k then I'd suggest buying some other samsung product or your preference. I've used the m31s and compared to this, that phone is way smooth, and many more models out there. But if you want a entry level phone, or coming from a feature phone, budget constraints, secondary phone. Then this is the phone to go with.  I personally like my m02 quite a bit.

Samsung should recall this model M02

  Guys if you are looking for a smartphone Please do not buy this product. Reasons are given below1. Battery life is not upto the Mark even in power saving mode. Drained very fast in just 15 hrs. If you watch movie then ot will drain in 4 hrs only.2. Camera. Both front and rear camera are just like vga camera. No quality of Megapixels.3. Hangs a lot. Takes too much to unlock and don't have a fingerprint scanner as well. No facelock option.4. Many times it dont show the caller number on screen for 5 to 10 seconds.When you are working on it and someone calls you then only ringtone will play first and small icon will appear on the top after 5-10 seconds. Unknown no. by truecaller will show when you disconnect call.5. I have not installed any game as it hangs in normal operation.6. Screen width is not upto mark,as keys of keyboard come closer. You will feel uncomfortable while typing.7. Sound quality is low, as no proper music beats.8. When you are on call the screen automatically flash and touch enables.Samsung should recall this model. Worst ever phone. You can add 2000 more and can get better phone than this.

  First I was happy that Samsung rolled out a budget phone under 7000 Rs. but later got disappointed that we have to bear slow processor. The processor is quite slow and the phone started hanging as soon as I booted for the very first time. Along with this drawback, the display is very cheap when it comes to expecting a nice one from a brand like Samsung. I would suggest not to go with the brand value but see the specifications before you buy and don't make the mistake which I made.

(206 gms)6- Found bugs like-(1) Pressing power button takes time to wake and sleep the screen.(2) Home screen zooms upto 300% without activating.(3) Opening camera stucks for upto 5-10 sec sometimes.(Will update more if found)Thanks!

Just don't buy it you will regret if you buy it.

  Believe me guys don't make mistake you will regret. This phone hangs a lot even at normal task like opening notification panel or settings or receiving calls. Better go for other brands if you are tight with your budget they buy new Gionee phones Gionee F103 pro was my first phone there are some software update problem but except that everything runs much smoother than this M02 and note it this Gionee phone was 5 years old and still you can play COD in it. Even i have played pubg recently before it was ban. Now i ordered new mobile because i was getting battery issue in my Gionee handset and trusted Samsung but i got something more bad than previous phone.Don't buy it!

Pathetic performing mobile
","

  Pathetic performance of the phone. My father in law was using old redmi 3i for past many years. Since it's battery was almost gone i bought this useless mobile with weakest processor. Opening a dialer itself takes 3-4 seconds. I didn't imagine this like sluggishness of the mobile from Samsung. Better i would've gone with xiomi or realme. Wasted Rs.7500.. lets see how long will it work

  So I ordered this phone 20 days ago I guessAs i got a good exchange offer for my repaired handset i only paid 900.About the product-The screen quality is awesome at this price point, the battery is also promising, build quality is above average however it doesn’t offer fingerprint which is pretty basic even at this price.The main concern with this handset is the ram management on this one creates problem. The multitasking can’t be done fluently and yes it lags a bitTo me I purchased this handset for my 2.5 years old niece as she loves watching videos throughout the day. So for us it was a health purchase but for those who want to use this as a primary phone. Please increase your budget otherwise you will be irritated.

Good phone for basic functions

  It's a very good budget phone from Samsung. I gifted it to my dad who doesn't use too many apps. Even then it hangs. And that too while doing basic functions like checking contact list. I don't know what will happen if resource intensive apps are run on this phone. Display is very good, this being an entry level phone. Big size and crisp resolution are big advantages. Recommended only of you don't use it for apps which are system hogs.

  The RAM could have been 4 GB instead of 3 GB, which could make this phone, a leader in the segment.User friendly functions which can guide the elderly to use this phone effortlessly - is a key attribute of this hand set. There is a lag in response that is encountered at times, and that may be due to its processor. Overall, a phone with a better utility value.

  It's been just 3 months and this mobile is hanging very often. I installed only 3 apps Whatsapp, Prime video, and FB lite and It can't even handle 3 apps. I can't take calls it stops while getting a call. Worst software from Samsung. The camera quality is also too bad, pictures are too dark taken from the rear camera. I also bought Galaxy M31s with 8GB & 128GB for 20 k, i don't use many apps, my RAM is 3.5 GB filled remaining 4.5 GB free, and still, the Galaxy M31s too hangs a lot. I don't think buying Samsung mobile is not a good idea

Beware of heating

  Within 2 days of ordering,received the phone,,simple to set it up but there is definitely an issue of excessive heating when watching a video or youtube,amazon's return policy is a simple efficient procedure and I got the phone replaced within 2 days of return.Replaced phone still has heating issue not to the extent of earlier one.So continuing to use but not very happy,even the software is a bit slow,,disappointed Samsung is peddling a low grade product,,my reason to stick to Samsung is all other phones in this price range Rs7999 which I paid are all chinese variety..If samsung continues to peddle low quality cheap phones manufactured out of their factory in India,more and more customers with reluctance will switch back to chinese..shame..Thumbs up for Amazon,,thumbs down for Samsung

Nice Budget Phone
","

  I have bought this phone for our office staff use and I find it quite good. Although the phone body is made of plastic but I think in this budget you can expect metal body and sturdy phone construction.I really feel bad when I open the phone as there is no Back Cover and Tempered glass is being provided with the phone. Because the phone is just launched stage, so there is non-availability of the back cover in the market and ultimately I had to pay 50% extra to buy the cover online.Rest if you talk about performance : its OK at this price ranger where in there is 3 GB RAM, you can not expect more than this at this processor and hardware installation.About Display: I am satisfied with the display part.Overall: I am satisfied at this price range.

  If you see the price the phone is worth at this price. I was expected more from Samsung in this phone. Lagging in multitasking. 3gb ram is good but need to improve processor. Updates are good. Camera quality is as similar as basic phones. Macro mode primary. Dont know why there is Micro usb port, hence my other Samsung mobiles having type c. Charger is 1.5 it should be 2.0. No headphones in pack. Data cable is very short. No screen guard. No silicon cover.I purchased for my son. Initially it will be used for zoom meeting and games. But with this processor it is hard to play games like freefire, coc, COD is impossible to play.Otherwise it is good for surfing, calls, battery life, normal video calls (no HD).

WORST MOBILE

  DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS MOBILE. On the very first day when I tried to start the handset , it didn't start and after a few times trying , it started. After a few minutes , it switched off by itself and wouldn't start. Right now I am running to and fro from the customer service of Vivo to get a replacement. SPARE YOURSELF OF ALL THIS TROUBLE BY NOT BUYING THIS MOBILE.

  Hey it's  genuine  phone with good features at this price point. But don't  expect too much from it like finger print and high end Camera.Let it suffice  that the phone doesn't  hang at all and is pleasantly  smooth provided ur working on less apps.👉 The processor is decent in this price range with definitely good battery life.👉 There is exchange offer whr I replaced my old Lenovo K3 note which was lagging but has same Ram.👉 The colour gives it a premium look and it less than 160gm which is less compared to heavy phones like redmi and Vivo U series. It is handy n slim at the same time.👉Pictures and different language  support in text and typos is a welcome feature.👉Overalll worth it at 7950 Rs. Nd exch worth 1500 or so.✋

  Worst product of vivo so far... It takes 4 hours and 26 minutes to get fully charged from 30% to 100%.. Very disappointing product. Oppo A1k is much more better in this price segment. I lost trust on Vivo after buying such a product. I am sharing the picture of the phone which I recieved day before yesterday.

  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000

Value for money. Buying Samsung product is contributing for innovation!
","

  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define ""Normal"". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)

  Don't buy any Mobile from Amazon if you are not fully aware abaout the product. After buying they are not entertain you for returning/replacement.

Only samsung mobile left in market if you don't want to buy any Chinese mobile. Not a single Indian mobile available in own Indian market.Samsung making good money with its cheap quality mobile phones.

  Not worth the price at all! I am writing the review after using 17 days!Pros.1. Handy piece tho a bit heavy it's good to operate.2. Front camera is cool.3. Good face lock AI.Cons.1. Worst camera ui and I don't think this time samsung has their quality over the camera the back camera is worst.2. Not a worthy battery life.3. Too highly priced.Totally I'm not satisfied!It's better to buy any other model other than this. If not the new realme model is of the same price almost of this and has super good features. You can choose that or any other model from Samsung itself but don't choose this model coz there are lot of flaws in this... so its not worth the price.Hope my review helped..

  Bought this one on 25th August, reviewing on 22nd September.Battery life with a pocket friendly size is the only good thing about this phone! The headphone jack is behaving so erratically...it automatically reduces or increase the volume of audio/video being played and despite pressing hard on the keys or trying different earphones, the problem persists...even after a factory reset.Also, the charging socket has stopped working properly, so now I have to place my phone at a specific angle or keep holding in my hands in that position while charging the phone!Screw you Amazon...7 days replacement policy is just not good enough!

branded value for money phone having Better quality than china make

  Samsung M series, great phone in this range all are value money. Let's see here the SAMSUNG M01 phone: red colour , thin design make gives beautiful phone look. It has optimised performance with low power consumption that's gives you longer battery life time. It does not have finger tip sensor, bought it for grand parent who do not actually need it, some time in emergency you don't wish to have these security features.  At this budget with exchange offer got a great deal a brand new phone with loaded feature at 6500, isn't good. Front camera is average, clarity is good however back dual camera is good, inbuilt animated shot can give you different experience. The phone having good voice and sound quality, inbuilt and expendable memories are now improved than older phones gives you the freedom to be entertain. I love the display quality of samsung this is unmatched feature. Phone size is small and compact so can easily carry it in pockets, or keep it with other phone if you keep two phone.If want to have phone at low budget or secondary phone for back- up with reliable brand it's a good choice.ver all it's a great quality branded value for money phone.

Good phone . DON'T BUY IT.
","

  This phone is meant for a very small group of people. First of all, it is a very small display compared to other flagship or even other low budget phone . The only reason one should buy this is either they love Samsung ui - android 10 or they need a backup phone with very less radiation. The snapdragon 400 chip set is a very outdated chip which does not provide even close to the performance from other phones from this range. Well , after this you might think that the camera might be great. Wrong again , the 8 mega pixel camera can maximum take photos uptown 4 mp(which is not of even good quality either) and the front facing camera is just trash.Talking about spec sheet, out the the 32 GB, you only get 20. And out 3GB ram , there is only 1.5 GB ram which you can use. Running simple applications take about 2.5 GB ram.Battery is decent(finally something good about the phone) but it will ofcourse be so ,as there has been compromises is every other part of the phone.  In the box comes a 5 watt charger which takes ages. At an age where phones can charge uptown 100 watt, it's totally unfair that samsung gives us 5 watt charger. There is no inbuilt screen protector or back case.The dual camera setup is just for name sake. Please don't buy this phone for the camera or performance.Like I said earlier,  this phone is useful for old grandparents or children with limited usage. With is budget,  you can get better phones such as narzo 10a or oppo phones which are better and give relatively good performance too.The phone doesn't lag much but due to the small screen , online class or videos will be hard to attend. If in case you plan to buy this phone , try contacting a physical store as they can give you a better price. Another problem I noticed, the charging cable is smaller than the normal size. Makes it difficult to charge.

An average Smartphone
","

  Overall it's an average Smartphone.I would tell you about some basic parameters.PERFORMANCE- This Smartphone is having an average Processor. So, don't even think of playing heavy games like COD or PUBG. But if you are buying for normal usage than it works quite well but lags sometime as it has 3GB RAM.CAMERA- It has a decent rear camera. Depth sensor is on average and clicks normal portrait shots. Front camera is below average so don't expect much from it.BATTERY- It has 4000 mAh battery so if you have a normal usage then it works easily for 12-15 hours once it is charged 90%. One problem is that it comes with a 5V/1A Charger so it takes much time to get charged.One more thing is that it doesn't have finger print scanner.It has face unlock that works quite well.At last I would say if you want to buy a non-chinese smartphone and your budget is around 8.5k-9k then you can go for it. This phone is for moderate use and from my view it will easily work for 3-4 years. And if you want gaming or better specs then either you go for Chinese phones or make your budget large.

Great for daily basic usage.
","

  DISPLAY: The TFT Display quality is good compared to other cheap brands, the viewing angle is also good, does not fade out much when you view it from different angle. Brightness is also sufficient.BATTERY: Battery life is very good. Hours of basic usage (online classes, calls, whatsapp, browsing) and hours of gaming. Using since 15 days, not found unnecessary battery drainage.CHARGING: It's little slow if you are used to a 10W of a fast charging mobile. 1% increment in charge takes 2 minutes and 10-15 seconds approx. But mobile does not heat at all during charging.PERFORMANCE: Zero lag during web browsing, youtube, switching between apps, online classes via skype, zoom & google meet. One UI is really very smooth. I don't play pubg, but it's easily playing games like ""IAF:A cut above"" in ultra graphic settings with no lag or frameskip.CAMERA: The major issue with this mobile is it's camera image quality in low light condition, it's very poor in low light (without flash) but with flash its ok ok type. However the back camera quality in day light or indoor light conditions is good, not soo good or bad, its just good. Selfie camera is not good at all. It needs softwere improvement.CALLS: Call quality is great and loud on both sides.CONCLUSION: If you need a compact, good looking, good in hand feel and durable non-chineese phone with basic to medium usage like online classes, low to medium intensity gaming and smooth ad-free Ui then definitely go for it. However if you want a camera centric phone taking pictures all the day and especially selfies, it's not for you.

Samsung M01 Good Quality Phone value for money
","

  Its a value for money product from Samsung. Though I am not a big Samsung Fan however this model is a superb option when your pocket is tight on budget and you need a good quality smartphone. Phone build quality is sturdy and gives a nice feel in hand and looks good too ,Battery life is good , camera quality is sufficient, screen is good but no fingerprint reader. I really like the screen size (5.7) which is far better that the big phones (6.+ screen size) , because of bit small screen phone fits well in hand and gives the easiness to use with single hand. Samsung should have also provided at least a wired earphone with the phone (should not cost Samsung much) which is missing in the box.

  You have way better options at this price. This phone is pathetic and its cam is scam, I ll tell you how. when you open cam and open wide angle mode cover one cam out of two. You would realize cam 1 is working, now change the view from wide angle to normal and check by covering cam again only cam1 is working cam 2 is a showpiece. I know how it works because I have other phone with 2 cams.Display avg. Battery is good, No option to do screen mirroring or smart view.Disappointed totally and now cant return...

  Now this is a great phone for its price point ( under 9k )Battery is great, display is bright, speaker voice is clear ( not the loudest but works 9/10 cases ), Great UI/UX of android, average camera.There are alternatives available of this phone and you can check them out too but you won't be disappointed with this one.Things you will miss -Wifi tech is older - it won't catch the ultra fast wifi networks ( still works well with average wifi connection )Bloatware - a lot of unnecessary apps ( doesn't annoy you but still feels forced )Average camera - works fine for good daylight pics but the focus is slow and is pretty bad in low light.Old charging port - Does not use the type-c standard now and no fast charging.

  Received the product before the delivery time. Nice look and feel. Camera quality is average and not bad. Face unlock works fine, but it is bit slow. No fingerprint reader and the same has been mentioned in the product description. Bit weight but not bulky. Charging time is more and no fast charging option available. Worst part is that it is taking minimum 4hrs for a complete charge. Good thing is that charging last for minimum 2days during normal use. It is an average non-chinese phone under 8k budget with decent performance.

  Samsung is just not able to deliver the quality the customer expect from it.There nothing good about this phone,Its slow, hangs if you download a few apps, even its not able to support half the capacity other phone of this range/memory/RAM can support.In just 30 days of delivery the phone showed a display problem, and when I visited their service centre, they said it will take at least 4 days to fix the display issue. Which I believe, if done outside wouldn't take more then 10 mins. And as per them you have to leave your phone with them for these 4-5 days when they will be ordering and arranging the display. As if you bought the phone for ur baby to play video games and you dont have any important needs from your smart phone.

  I bought this for my aunt. Performance is good actually. I’ve put lots of apps and the speed was good. Speaker is not that loud but for the price it is good. Camera is bad but for people not wanting it, it gets the job done! I’ve also bought M01 core (2GB) which is way inferior compared to this. M01 core’s camera is worse than this. For people using only Facebook, Whatsapp... M01 core would be fine but for a price difference of only ₹1900; M01 offers a lot more!

Disappointed

  Took 2 phones in my family. I did not want to buy a Chinese product so purchased Samsung. This phone doesn't catch the signal well compared to all our previous phones. We had great difficulty in answering calls in our home. It was noted that it does not switch to the 4G/3G/2G network appropriately and holds on to the 4G network even when the signal is extremely poor. To overcome this problem we had to use one sim to select network automatically and one sim with 2G network only.I personally use Nokia 6.1 Plus which is excellent in identifying appropriate network in the same room and with same mobile network. Also it is clean, better quality, and most importantly gets timely updates and does not lag even after 2 years.I used Samsung j7 previously and that also had similar problems and was dead slow within 2 years. Samsung should seriously work on this.Mobile is basically used for calls, camera, google maps, and games. Phone does not use the mobile network appropriately. Cameras are not competetive in the mid segment. Samsung does not provide compass in most of the mid segment phones apart from recent M series. Phones get dead slow and lag within one year. It has lot of unwanted apps just like another Chinese phone. Then what good is the brand value and after sales service for. Probably it is only focusing on their premium customers.

Be very careful and read all the things while buying costly items. This phone is definitely a refurbished phone. Not working properly. I am not going to use it.

  Post 3 days of usage :Battery - Excellent battery backup (goes up to 2nd day effortlessly - gaming not included in usage).Charging - Fast charging is a miss vs competition brands but while using the device didnt feel it as missing since device sustains entire day smoothly so no probs.Built - Plastic built but from the looks alone it feels good (have a red one) not premium though.The size of the device makes it a superb grip and ease of use with single hand.Display & Touch - Display is small vs  competition. Colour/Brightness is decent enough; no complaints at all. Touch is buttery smooth.OS - Android 10 (though not stock android like Nokia) advantage against competition; very few devices below 10K giving Android10 as out of the box. One would experience it during daily usage.Camera - Worst of the lot i guess; shaky, noisy images and videos (rear and front both) .. it was a shock - Samsung should do something about it in the next s/w update.Except Camera rest the device is very good at the price point!

  So, still now all my phones have been ordered from different online platforms. Never did I face such an issue with any of the devices. Samsung M01, I ordered and delivery was done within 24hours.Now after using it for another 24hours, I find the phone heating up within 20-30mins of using internet. Or even a mere phone call is making the phone hot.I preferred Samsung over Redmi to avoid this heating issue. Moreover,right now... No heavy apps are installed in the phone as well.I called up amazon customer care service. They have fixed an appointment where a technician will visit me to check the phone. However, I'm not at all willing to use the phone anyone and whan to exchange it. The executive told me, that only after inspection they will be able to give me further status. However, I hope I have a good experience with Amazon service. Otherwise this will be definitely the end of my relationship with Amazon.

It's a camera rather a smart phone
","

  Hi guys,I from mumbai bought this mobile in October 2020. Thought it is not a Chinese mobile but ...I did not like the phone the camera images is nice but as a smart phone not at all.There are lots of glitches1. It is not have finger print reader. It has face reader sensors in that you have a problem in unlocking is that your face position and light on the face should be same while it was at the time of setting. So most of the time you have to go to pin no. you have set you press the right pin no. Then you have to press OK button also. Why the hell I press OK button if I press right pin no. This is not a sign of a smart phone?2. Another great disadvantage is this phone  doesn't support LED indicator for charging for a phone it is a must feature in day today life how come in the night you come to know that battery you kept for charging is charging for not some times cable gets loosen and a simple red light indicator tells us you need to charge mobile immediately. If this feature is not there how you will cop up day today function and what is more shocking it does not support either battery % sign along the battery sign for that you have manually drop down the notifications bar to see the % sign.3. No internet speed indicator in notifications bar. As well in options.4. No screen shot capture button in notifications bar as well in short button list. Only age old system for screen shot pressing power and sound button together. No option of  three finger scroll down like wise it tell that press palm side but it doesn't happen. More after taking the screen shot it goes in the gallery you cannot send the image directly.5. Another glitch is in phone numbers it self if you press phone icon then you have to choose you want a dial a pad or recently calls or contacts, in other mobiles you get list of recently dialed calls list along with dial pad. And the height is that if you press from resents calls inteasted of calling it goes another screen asking you want to call, SMS, what up ... rather then calling you have again have to press that calling button.6. While operating another glitch is,while watching jio tv or prime, when we press home the thing we are watching in jio or prime is still seen at the bottom left side of the mobile and you have to clear it and then again open the app.7. From 32 gb the internal software itself eats up 9 gb and when I installed my applications and When I updated phone version from that time the mobile gets slow in operating.THIS PHONE IS RATHER MORE OF CAMERA THAN A SMART PHONE.Updated on 27/11/2020This phone does not have magnometer aido so you can't have compass on this phone.This phone also cannot be use as a remote for AC, TV etc.This phone also have another glitch when you receive phone on WhatsApp and if your phone is off only bell rings it does not open the screen you to press the ON button then you have to press your PIN no to open mobile then WhatsApp to receive call by the time call goes off.

Good Small Phone

  For those who want a compact phone, this one is perfectly sized for one handed usage. Display is not that bad but little bit of light bleeding on the top and bottom corners. Maybe I also got a defective unit like many other. Samsung should do proper quality check. Sound is loud and crisp. Doesn't lag for day to day usage. Battery lasts a whole day if minimally used. The speaker is on the backside which is little disappointing as it is a backward design. If it had a fingerprint reader it would have been an awesome phone. Software gives peace of mind, no ads or bloatwares thanks to One UI. Overall my rating is 3.5/5.

  Like : Right now fast access, feather touch key, good camera and picture quality, excellent customer care and remote access of the phone.Dislike: Some important feature like 'Screenshot' is absent in scroll up menu that is to be brought from Accesibility option of setting and put on Assistant menu. Which should be a ready option in scroll up menus. Incoming phone call sound quality was very poor however that was resolved by guidance from Customer care by remote accessing.Battery life which needs to be more longer.

  Have been searching for a midrange phone but priority was for compact size. Except Apple and Google its almost rare to find a decent phone with display less than 6inch in 2021. The 5.7inch display phone is so comfortable to hold and for one hand use. The One UI looks clean and no unnecessary bloatwares. Next to Stock Android. Yes it misses out on fingerprint reader but has face unlock. No FHD Amoled/IPS Display but display quality and viewing angle is not bad. Also no Fast Charging. People who use phone just for calling, chatting and other normal usage this is pretty much value for money. Gave 5stars to support brands launching compact phones in an era of tablet sized phones.

  Build quality is really good. I like Samsung Glance app showing news on our interests in the lock screen. My old phone had fingerprint sensor which is missing in M01 but face lock and unlock does the trick and works well. Likewise, I used android one UI in earlier phone. The only feature that i miss is swipe left from home screen to get Google news feed. But then again, its a software feature. My earlier phone was a 16K costing one and still it lasted only 1.5 years and i learnt that since the hynix eMMC used in device hit its lifetime, writes started failing and so phone became unusable. So, I wanted to buy Samsung this time as Samsung eMMC would be more reliable and would last longer. Snapdragon 439 SoC processor is just right enough for regular phone use. Camera still pictures would look super good provided person holds the phone still and even after clicking needs to hold the phone still for couple of seconds or else, the pic appears distorted. Would recommend this phone for sure as it is sturdy and very good value for money.

  I was pleasantly surprised to see on Amazon about the Samsung M01 available for the unbelievable price of Rs. 7499. I was looking for a phone for my wife. With the brand value of a company like Samsung, and with my experience with our Samsung phones which we have been using for few years without a hitch, I didn't have to look elsewhere to make the decision to go for it. I got a very good exchange value as well for the old Samsung phone.After using it for a week, I am very happy about the performance of the phone. With a 4000 mAh battery, it easily last for 2 days if you are not a heavy user. Display, camera and the UI are quite good. With Android10 and Samsung's OneUI core 2.0 it is a real bargain. It is an outstanding phone in this price range. Real value for money.

Super satisfied

  Reviewing the device after using it for more than a week. Find my pros and cons below:Pros:1. Battery: Battery backup is super impressive if you are a normal user. I don't play games but have to take calls through the day as I am working from home and I also use its hotspot throughout the day and the battery doesn't disappoint.2. Camera - I know that this is the new age of triple and quad camera setups in mobile phone but I have to say that even though I had very less expectations from the camera it does a wonderful job. The samsung camera app is superb and even though it has limited features it still performs fabulously in daylight and nicely in artificial or low light.3. One UI- The Samsung's very own android skin is amazingly cool and makes the user experience so much better.4. Display- Even though this is an LCD display still the colours are punchy and even in sunlight the display performs well.5. Biometric- The face unlock performs nicely and unlocks the device in a jiffy.You will not regret the absence of a fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Charger: As it is a 4000 mAh battery the absence of a fast charger is something that hurts. They could have included the 15 watt adapter that they offer with other devices.2. Case: Though not really a necessity, presence of a protective case would have been so much better.There aren't too many cons as this is a really good device for normal usage and you would be able to use it for all your essential needs for day to day basis.

  This phone is very good if you love to have handy phone and hate 6.5"" phones that are flooding the market. If you are comfortable with 6.5"" display then there are lot of better options in same price of 7499. I am not going to name anyone but better don't by this.Only bad things which I didn't expected from well established brand is WiFi calling implementation. Very poor and keeps disconnecting on fiber broadband.2nd problem is extremely slow charging. Taking 5 hrs frpm 0 to100.3rd is totally chindipana from brand by giving not even half meter usb cable that is totally useless ( slightly larger than what we get with power banks.

Good phone with some unexpected cons
","

  But there are some unexpected cons which weren't clear enough with the spec-sheets.1. There is no support for 5ghz wifi. You can neither connect to a 5ghz wifi nor create a 5ghz wifi hotspot. Being in 2020, I have taken it for granted.2. Samsung gallery doesn't have the sync option with OneDrive as S series. You are forced to use an older version of Samsung gallery on this phone. And if you want to sync, you better use google photos and Samsung gallery completely.3. You don't get a compass and magnetometer.3. Many preloaded apps, and some of them are not uninstallable notably, OneDrive and Netflix (you can only disable these).4. Default Weather app has ads and no way to disable it.

A concisely beautiful phone!
","

  For someone who is not a fan of oversized screen taking the whole space of your pocket, this is a boon from heaven. Before writing this review, I read a lot of negative comments vilifying the phone on its size and specs. Well let me tell you, in current times Samsung has conceived a very practical phone from its factories.Agreed, its camera while focusing gives a blurred and rather disturbed resolution but after clicking you get a finely processed image which looks as real as reality. Its camera specs are comparable to another cutie, the iPhone 6S.Would have loved an AMOLED screen and quick charging facilities (Type C) but then it would have added to the cost, losing its budget-friendly moniker.

Very good non-chinese phone at this price
","

  I am happy that this South Korean phone, which is Manufactured in India, has very nice features at its price. Battery lasts pretty long. The phone doesn't heat at all while using, calling or even charging. Camera is fairly well at this price range. Build quality of phone is also pretty good.Just go for this Non-Chinese phone!! You may compromise little bit on features compared to Redmi phones in this price range but I really think we all should now move out from Chinese to Non-Chinese brands.

Compact and powerfull
","

  I just needed a smaller phone for day to day usage. These days all phones are over 6.5 inches so buying this phone with 5.7 inch low bezel display was a dream. It fits perfectly in hand and one handed use is very easy. Coming to the performance, the UI is very smooth. Apps open and close instantly and RAM management is also very good. You can easily rely on this phone for heavy tasks but it takes a hit from gaming as the GPU is not very strong. Gamers will also probably find it difficult to play in the smaller sceeen. The battery is very good and may also last upto 2 days with minimal use. Basically, if you want a handy phone with great battery life and performance for daily tasks like, YouTube, browsing, social media, etc then this is the way to go. The only cons in this phone is the camera which takes good photos only in broad daylight and slow charging

Samsung Galaxy M01 user review
","

  I am using this phone for more than a week now. I'll try to lay down the pros and cons.Pros:-* Perfect size, best for single hand use and also good enough for watching films and videos.* Battery life is decent, with moderate to slightly heavy usage it easily lasts for a day or more.* Android 10 from the box.* With3gb/32g it functions quite smoothly. No lags whatsoever.* The speaker sound is loud enough and clear.Cons:-* No fingerprint scanner, the face unlock doesn't work well. So you need to depend on pattern or pin unlock.* Doesn't support fast charging, takes around 3.5 hrs for full charge.Some othe points :-* The camera is definitely not the best in the budget but is ok considering the price point.* display isn't amoled but its again decent enough for the price.Finally i would definitely recommend this phone to the ones who are searching for phones in the budget segment with the brand assurance of Samsung and a single hand usable device.

Nice phone in the starting range
","

  The phone meets the basic requirements. Do not buy if you have high expectations from your smartphone. The camera quality is very average and even poor in low light. So, this is an ideal phone for people who are transitioning from standard mobile phones to smartphones. Look-wise this looks really good.

Perfect sized phone for all your daily chores.
","

  The Samsung M01 is like a breath of fresh air amid the big screen mobile phones. The phone is really handy with a great user experience. One can operate and carry it around with ease. In my opinion, this is the USP of the product.As far as the technical specifications are concerned, it will run most applications however it is unreasonable to expect heavy multitasking/gaming on the device. It's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 with 3GB RAM, the specification is outdated but it is good enough for most of your daily use. I didn't expect a smooth experience with these specifications but Samsung has done a brilliant job with the One UI 2.0.Apart from all the good reasons to buy the phone, the phone seriously lacks a good camera and a fingerprint reader. However, at this price point IMO this is the best phone, the tradeoffs are easily overcome by its handiness, experience and security features.

  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Mobile quality n function is OK. But now a days companies providing charging cable much less from charger to phone. Not understand giving this much less cable. You can see in video the length of cable. Earlier I have used Panasonic Eluga Ray Max and its charging cable is sufficient and length having 42 inch (105) and present charges having 32inch(80cm).

Amazing M01 !!!!
","

  Very economical, an excellent phone for this budget.PROS...Since it is Android 10, we can apply dark mode and hence battery consumption is less.Also, even latest apps can be installed in this smartphone due to android 10.3GB Ram provides an excellent working condition to this phone. Even Pubg can be played in this phone without any sort of hang.Massive screen with infinity V display helps to see the online classes and movies very clearly.Dolby atmos provides an excellent utility to this phone. Even with a worthless earbud, by using Dolby atmos, it sounds good.It has a huge battery of 4000mAh and also massive  storage of 32 gb ram, which is worthy for a normal user.LAST but NOT LEAST, I'm very happy to hear that this is an INDIAN smartphone designed by INDIANS. Make in IndiaCONS...Even it has an octa core processor, its processor is very low when compared to redmi and realme phones in this price range.It does not have a fingerprint scanner, but has a fast face unlock.Even though it has a huge battery, it has a 2hrs charging time.So although it has some cons, it is a smartphone with many pros and some cons. I like it very much.What about you ???

Very satisfied; good no-frills and no-nonsense value for money
","

  Have been using it for last 3 weeks, and it meets every expectation I had when I purchased it. I was looking for:1. Small size... I.e. smaller than the 6+ inch screen which seems to have become the norm.2. Reliable non Chinese make3. Decent specs in terms of processor and RAM and battery (was not very particular abt the camera)4. Low price.. budget was 10 kAm unfortunately unable to take good care of my phones, and am also trying to reduce screen time.. so, this seemed overall to be the best choice available, and now I can say that it is the best choice available for someone looking for those things. It has seamlessly slipped into my usage without any fuss or trouble at all.
